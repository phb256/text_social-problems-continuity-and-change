The top-left cell and bottom-right cell consist of people who behave in ways we would normally expect. The top-left one consists of “active bigots,” in Merton’s terminology, people who are both prejudiced and discriminatory. An example of such a person is the white owner of an apartment building who dislikes people of color and refuses to rent to them. The bottom-right cell consists of “all-weather liberals,” as Merton called them, people who are neither prejudiced nor discriminatory. An example would be someone who holds no stereotypes about the various racial and ethnic groups and treats everyone the same regardless of her or his background.</p>

On the bottom left, we see people who are prejudiced but who nonetheless do not discriminate; Merton called them “timid bigots.” An example would be white restaurant owners who do not like people of color but still serve them anyway because they want their business or are afraid of being sued if they do not serve them. At the top right, we see “fair-weather liberals,” or people who are not prejudiced but who still discriminate. An example would be white store owners in the South during the segregation era who thought it was wrong to treat blacks worse than whites but who still refused to sell to them because they were afraid of losing white customers.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_p02">To many observers, the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in February 2012 was a deadly example of individual discrimination. Martin, a 17-year-old African American, was walking in a gated community in Sanford, Florida, as he returned from a 7-Eleven with a bag of Skittles and some iced tea. An armed neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, called 911 and said Martin looked suspicious. Although the 911 operator told Zimmerman not to approach Martin, Zimmerman did so anyway; within minutes Zimmerman shot and killed the unarmed Martin and later claimed self-defense. According to many critics of this incident, Martin’s only “crime” was “walking while black.” As an African American newspaper columnist observed, “For every black man in America, from the millionaire in the corner office to the mechanic in the local garage, the Trayvon Martin tragedy is personal. It could have been me or one of my sons. It could have been any of us” (Robinson, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_044">Robinson, E. (2012, March 23).

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s01_p03">Much individual discrimination occurs in the workplace, as sociologist Denise Segura (Segura, 1992)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_045">Segura, D.

More than 40 percent of the women said they had encountered workplace discrimination based on their ethnicity and/or gender, and they attributed their treatment to stereotypes held by their employers and coworkers. Along with discrimination, they were the targets of condescending comments like “I didn’t know that there were any educated people in Mexico that have a graduate degree.”</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Institutional Discrimination</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p01">Individual discrimination is important to address, but at least as consequential in today’s world is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">institutional discrimination</a><span class="glossdef">Discrimination that pervades the practices of whole institutions, such as housing, medical care, law enforcement, employment, and education, even if such discrimination is not intended.</span></span>, or discrimination that pervades the practices of whole institutions, such as housing, medical care, law enforcement, employment, and education. This type of discrimination does not just affect a few isolated people of color. Instead, it affects large numbers of individuals simply because of their race or ethnicity. Sometimes institutional discrimination is also based on gender, disability, and other characteristics.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p02">In the area of race and ethnicity, institutional discrimination often stems from prejudice, as was certainly true in the South during segregation. However, just as individuals can discriminate without being prejudiced, so can institutions when they engage in practices that seem to be racially neutral but in fact have a discriminatory effect. Individuals in institutions can also discriminate without realizing it. They make decisions that turn out, upon close inspection, to discriminate against people of color even if they did not mean to do so.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p03">The bottom line is this: Institutions can discriminate even if they do not intend to do so. Consider height requirements for police. Before the 1970s, police forces around the United States commonly had height requirements, say five feet ten inches. As women began to want to join police forces in the 1970s, many found they were too short. The same was true for people from some racial/ethnic backgrounds, such as Latinos, whose stature is smaller on the average than that of non-Latino whites. Of course, even many white males were too short to become police officers, but the point is that even more women, and even more men of certain ethnicities, were too short.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p04">This gender and ethnic difference is not, in and of itself, discriminatory as the law defines the term. The law allows for <em class="emphasis">bona fide</em> (good faith) physical qualifications for a job. As an example, we would all agree that someone has to be able to see to be a school bus driver; sight therefore is a <em class="emphasis">bona fide</em> requirement for this line of work. Thus even though people who are blind cannot become school bus drivers, the law does not consider such a physical requirement to be discriminatory.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p05">But were the height restrictions for police work in the early 1970s <em class="emphasis">bona fide</em> requirements? Women and members of certain ethnic groups challenged these restrictions in court and won their cases, as it was decided that there was no logical basis for the height restrictions then in effect. In short (pun intended), the courts concluded that a person did not have to be five feet ten inches to be an effective police officer. In response to these court challenges, police forces lowered their height requirements, opening the door for many more women, Latino men, and some other men to join police forces (Appier, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_046">Appier, J. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Policing women: The sexual politics of law enforcement and the LAPD</em>. Philadelphia, PA: Temple University Press.</span> Whether police forces back then intended their height requirements to discriminate, or whether they honestly thought their height requirements made sense, remains in dispute. Regardless of the reason, their requirements did discriminate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_p06">Institutional discrimination affects the life chances of people of color in many aspects of life today. To illustrate this, we turn briefly to some examples of institutional discrimination that have been the subject of government investigation and scholarly research.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Health Care</h2>

One question that arises is why their health is worse. One possible answer involves institutional discrimination based on race and ethnicity.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_s01_p02">Several studies use hospital records to investigate whether people of color receive optimal medical care, including coronary bypass surgery, angioplasty, and catheterization. After taking the patients’ medical symptoms and needs into account, these studies find that African Americans are much less likely than whites to receive the procedures just listed. This is true when poor blacks are compared to poor whites and also when middle-class blacks are compared to middle-class whites (Smedley, Stith, &amp; Nelson, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_047">Smedley, B. D., Stith, A. Y., &amp; Nelson, A. R. (2003). <em class="emphasis">Unequal treatment: Confronting racial and ethnic disparities in health care</em>. Washington, DC: National Academies Press.</span> In a novel way of studying race and cardiac care, one study performed an experiment in which several hundred doctors viewed videos of African American and white patients, all of whom, unknown to the doctors, were actors. In the videos, each “patient” complained of identical chest pain and other symptoms. The doctors were then asked to indicate whether they thought the patient needed cardiac catheterization. The African American patients were less likely than the white patients to be recommended for this procedure (Schulman et al., 1999).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_048">Schulman, K. A., et al. (1999). The effect of race and sex on physicians’ recommendations for cardiac catheterization. <em class="emphasis">The New England Journal of Medicine, 340</em>, 618–626.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_s01_p03">Why does discrimination like this occur? It is possible, of course, that some doctors are racists and decide that the lives of African Americans just are not worth saving, but it is far more likely that they have <em class="emphasis">unconscious</em> racial biases that somehow affect their medical judgments. Regardless of the reason, the result is the same: African Americans are less likely to receive potentially life-saving cardiac procedures simply because they are black. Institutional discrimination in health care, then, is literally a matter of life and death.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_s02_p01">When loan officers review mortgage applications, they consider many factors, including the person’s income, employment, and credit history. The law forbids them to consider race and ethnicity. Yet African Americans and Latinos are more likely than whites to have their mortgage applications declined (Blank, Venkatachalam, McNeil, &amp; Green, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_049">Blank, E.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_s02_p02">To control for this possibility, researchers take these factors into account and in effect compare whites, African Americans, and Latinos with similar incomes, employment, and credit histories. Some studies are purely statistical, and some involve white, African American, and Latino individuals who independently visit the same mortgage-lending institutions. Both types of studies find that African Americans and Latinos are still more likely than whites with similar qualifications to have their mortgage applications rejected (Turner et al., 2002).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_050">Turner, M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_s02_p04">Mortgage rejections and redlining contribute to another major problem facing people of color: residential segregation. Housing segregation is illegal but is nonetheless widespread because of mortgage rejections and other processes that make it very difficult for people of color to move out of segregated neighborhoods and into unsegregated areas. African Americans in particular remain highly segregated by residence in many cities, much more so than is true for other people of color. The residential segregation of African Americans is so extensive that it has been termed <em class="emphasis">hypersegregation</em> and more generally called American apartheid (Massey &amp; Denton, 1993).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_052">Massey, D. S., &amp; Denton, N. A. (1993). <em class="emphasis">American apartheid: Segregation and the making of the underclass</em>. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_s02_p05">In addition to mortgage rejections, a pattern of subtle discrimination by realtors and homeowners makes it difficult for African Americans to find out about homes in white neighborhoods and to buy them (Pager, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_053">Pager, D.

New York, NY: Russell Sage Foundation.</span> For example, realtors may tell African American clients that no homes are available in a particular white neighborhood, but then inform white clients of available homes. The now routine posting of housing listings on the Internet might be reducing this form of housing discrimination, but not all homes and apartments are posted, and some are simply sold by word of mouth to avoid certain people learning about them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s04_s02_s02_p06">The hypersegregation experienced by African Americans cuts them off from the larger society, as many rarely leave their immediate neighborhoods, and results in <em class="emphasis">concentrated poverty</em>, where joblessness, crime, and other problems reign. For several reasons, then, residential segregation is thought to play a major role in the seriousness and persistence of African American poverty (Rothstein, 2012; Stoll, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_054">Rothstein, R.

Sociologist Devah Pager (2003)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_056">Pager, D. (2003). The mark of a criminal record. <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Sociology, 108</em>, 937–975.</span> had young white and African American men apply independently in person for entry-level jobs. They dressed the same and reported similar levels of education and other qualifications. Some applicants also admitted having a criminal record, while other applicants reported no such record. As might be expected, applicants with a criminal record were hired at lower rates than those without a record. However, in striking evidence of racial discrimination in hiring, African American applicants <em class="emphasis">without</em> a criminal record were hired at the same low rate as the white applicants <em class="emphasis">with</em> a criminal record.</p>

                    <li>People who practice racial or ethnic discrimination are usually also prejudiced, but not always. Some people practice discrimination without being prejudiced, and some may not practice discrimination even though they are prejudiced.</li>
                    <li>Individual discrimination is common and can involve various kinds of racial slights. Much individual discrimination occurs in the workplace.</li>
                    <li>Institutional discrimination often stems from prejudice, but institutions can also practice racial and ethnic discrimination when they engage in practices that seem to be racially neutral but in fact have a discriminatory effect.</li>
