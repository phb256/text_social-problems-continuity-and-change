        <h2 class="title editable block">The Sexual Revolution: Changing Attitudes and Changing Behavior</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p01">The 1960s were a time of major change in the United States. The Southern civil rights movement and Vietnam antiwar movements shook the nation, and the women’s rights, gay rights, and environmental movements began. Another major change was the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sexual revolution</a><span class="glossdef">A substantial change during the 1960s and 1970s in many aspects of Americans’ sexual behavior and in how they thought about sex.</span></span>, which saw a substantial change in many aspects of Americans’ sexual behavior and in how they thought about sex. Thanks in large part to the introduction of the birth control pill, women became freer to have sex without fear of pregnancy. The hippies of the youth counterculture of the 1960s emphasized <em class="emphasis">free love</em>, the idea that sexual intercourse and other forms of sex need not be delayed until marriage, and a popular slogan heard during the Vietnam antiwar movement was “make love, not war.” A highlight (or lowlight, depending on one’s view) of the era was the Summer of Love in 1967, when tens of thousands of young people gathered in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco to do drugs, have sex, and engage in other counterculture activities. The appearance of HIV and AIDS during the 1980s reversed some of the trends of the sexual revolution, as people became more concerned about the consequences of unprotected sex, but the effects of this revolution largely remain: Many more people now have sex before marriage than before the 1960s, and views about certain sexual behaviors have become less conservative since the 1960s and 1970s (Harding &amp; Jencks, 2003).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_002">Harding, D. J., &amp; Jencks, C. (2003). Changing attitudes toward premarital sex. <em class="emphasis">Public Opinion Quarterly, 67</em>(2), 211–226.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p02">We can see evidence of changing views about sex in data from the General Social Survey (GSS), which has been administered nationally since the early 1970s. One of the questions the GSS asks is about premarital sex: “There’s been a lot of discussion about the way morals and attitudes about sex are changing in this country. If a man and woman have sex relations before marriage, do you think it is always wrong, almost always wrong, wrong only sometimes, or not wrong at all?” In 1972, only 27.2 percent of the public replied it was “not wrong at all,” but by 2010, this percentage almost doubled to 53.1 percent (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_f01">Figure 9.1 "Change in Views about Premarital Sex (Percentage Saying Premarital Sex Is “Not Wrong at All”)"</a>).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p03">On two other issues, extramarital sex and sex between teenagers, views have not changed from a generation ago. Very few Americans today, fewer than 5 percent, think that either type of sexual behavior is “not wrong at all,” and very few thought they were not wrong a generation ago when the GSS asked about these two behaviors. As all these trend data indicate, the sexual revolution changed certain sexual attitudes but did not affect other attitudes. In this respect, then, the sexual revolution was only partly revolutionary.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_p04">Certain changes in sexual behavior also occurred as part of the sexual revolution. In particular, many more people began having sex before age 18 during and after the 1960s than before the 1960s and, in a related trend, to have more sexual partners before age 18 (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, &amp; Michaels, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_003">Laumann, E. O., Gagnon, J. H., Michael, R. T., &amp; Michaels, S. (1994). <em class="emphasis">The social organization of sexuality</em>. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</span> We can see evidence of the former trend in national survey data reported in <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s01_t01">Table 9.1 "Percentage Who Had Heterosexual Sex before Age 18"</a>, which shows the percentage of people born in different decades (<em class="emphasis">birth cohorts</em>) who had sex before age 18. Among women, less than one-third of those in the 1933–1942 and 1943–1952 birth cohorts (who would all have reached age 18 <em class="emphasis">before</em> the sexual revolution) had sex before age 18. These low figures jumped to 47.6 percent for those in the 1953–1962 birth cohort (who became teenagers in the 1960s and 1970s, <em class="emphasis">during</em> the sexual revolution) and then grew further to 58.2 percent in the next birth cohort. In a twenty-year span, then, women became 28.2 percent more likely (= 58.2 – 30.0) to have sex before age 18. Men, too, became more likely to have sex before age 18, though at a slightly smaller rate of increase, 18.8 percent (= 61.3 – 42.5) over the thirty-year span shown in the table. In related figures, only 30 percent of teenaged girls in 1972 were sexually experienced; by 1988, this figure had jumped to 51 percent (Martinez, Copen, &amp; Abma, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_004">Martinez, G., Copen, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_p01">Americans’ attitudes today about heterosexual behavior are very diverse. On some issues, Americans are fairly united, either in a more tolerant and accepting direction or in a less tolerant and unaccepting direction. On other issues, Americans are fairly divided, with large numbers of people feeling one way and large numbers feeling another way. The American public is probably even more diverse in its sexual behavior: Some people have a lot of sex and engage in a variety of sexual activities, while other people have less sex and limit their sexual activity to vaginal intercourse. To gain a sense of what Americans are thinking and doing in the area of heterosexual activity, national surveys provide some important evidence.</p>

This time we will focus on the percentage who say the behaviors are wrong (“always wrong,” “almost always wrong,” or “sometimes wrong”) (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_s01_f01">Figure 9.2 "Views on Sexual Behavior (Percentage Saying the Behavior Is Wrong)"</a>).</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_s01_p03">Certain aspects of our social backgrounds predict our views about premarital sex.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_s02_p01">A good understanding of Americans’ sexual behaviors comes from the 2006–2008 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), which was administered to 13,459 Americans ages 15–44 nationwide. Although this survey omits people older than 44, it still yields valuable information about people in their prime reproductive years. <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch05#barkansoc_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Sexual Orientation and Inequality"</a> on sexual orientation also used some NSFG data.</p>

Although many people think that males are much more sexually active than females, the data in <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_s02_t01">Table 9.2 "Lifetime Prevalence of Sexual Behaviors, Ages 15–24*"</a> show that the gender differences in heterosexual contact are practically nonexistent. Reflecting a conclusion from <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch05#barkansoc_1.0-ch05">Chapter 5 "Sexual Orientation and Inequality"</a>’s discussion of sexual orientation, however, females are more likely than males to have had same-sex sexual contact. In one other gender difference not reported in the table, males (17.6 percent) are more likely than females (9.4 percent) to have at least two heterosexual partners in the past year. In this specific sexual activity, then, males are indeed more active than females.</p>

Does this mean that religiosity should also be associated with a lower likelihood of actually engaging in premarital sex? The answer is clearly yes, as many studies of adolescents find that those who are more religious are more likely to still be virgins and, if they have had sex, more likely to have had fewer sexual partners (Regenerus, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_005">Regenerus, M.

New York, NY: Oxford Univeristy Press.</span> Survey data on adults yield a similar finding: Among all never-married adults in the GSS, those who are more religious are also more likely to have had fewer sexual partners (Barkan, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_006">Barkan, S. E. (2006). Religiosity and premarital sex during adulthood. <em class="emphasis">Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, 45</em>, 407–417.</span> We see evidence of this relationship in <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s01_s02_s02_t02">Table 9.3 "Self-Rated Religiosity and Number of Sexual Partners in Past Five Years among Never-Married Adults Ages 18–39 (%)"</a>, which shows that among never-married adults ages 18–39, those who are very religious are more likely to have had no sexual partners in the past five years and, if they have had any partners, to have had fewer partners. Although it is hypothetically possible that not having sexual partners leads someone to become more religious, it is much more likely that being very religious reduces the number of sexual partners that never-married adults have.</p>
