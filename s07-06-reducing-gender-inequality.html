    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s06_p01">Gender inequality is found in varying degrees in most societies around the world, and the United States is no exception. Just as racial/ethnic stereotyping and prejudice underlie racial/ethnic inequality (see <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch03#barkansoc_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Racial and Ethnic Inequality"</a>), so do stereotypes and false beliefs underlie gender inequality. Although these stereotypes and beliefs have weakened considerably since the 1970s thanks in large part to the contemporary women’s movement, they obviously persist and hamper efforts to achieve full gender equality.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s06_p02">A sociological perspective reminds us that gender inequality stems from a complex mixture of cultural and structural factors that must be addressed if gender inequality is to be reduced further than it already has been since the 1970s. Despite changes during this period, children are still socialized from birth into traditional notions of femininity and masculinity, and gender-based stereotyping incorporating these notions still continues. Although people should certainly be free to pursue whatever family and career responsibilities they desire, socialization and stereotyping still combine to limit the ability of girls and boys and women and men alike to imagine less traditional possibilities. Meanwhile, structural obstacles in the workplace and elsewhere continue to keep women in a subordinate social and economic status relative to men.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s06_p03">To reduce gender inequality, then, a sociological perspective suggests various policies and measures to address the cultural and structural factors that help produce gender inequality. These steps might include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s06_l02">
        <li>Reduce socialization by parents and other adults of girls and boys into traditional gender roles.</li>
        <li>Confront gender stereotyping by the popular and news media.</li>
        <li>Increase public consciousness of the reasons for, extent of, and consequences of rape and sexual assault, sexual harassment, and pornography.</li>
        <li>Increase enforcement of existing laws against gender-based employment discrimination and against sexual harassment.</li>
        <li>Increase funding of rape-crisis centers and other services for girls and women who have been raped and/or sexually assaulted.</li>
        <li>Increase government funding of high-quality day-care options to enable parents, and especially mothers, to work outside the home if they so desire, and to do so without fear that their finances or their children’s well-being will be compromised.</li>
        <li>Increase mentorship and other efforts to boost the number of women in traditionally male occupations and in positions of political leadership.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s06_p04">As we consider how best to reduce gender inequality, the impact of the contemporary women’s movement must be neither forgotten nor underestimated. Since it began in the late 1960s, the women’s movement has generated important advances for women in almost every sphere of life. Brave women (and some men) challenged the status quo by calling attention to gender inequality in the workplace, education, and elsewhere, and they brought rape and sexual assault, sexual harassment, and domestic violence into the national consciousness. For gender inequality to continue to be reduced, it is essential that a strong women’s movement continue to remind us of the sexism that still persists in American society and the rest of the world.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Reducing Rape and Sexual Assault</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s06_s01_p01">As we have seen, gender inequality also manifests itself in the form of violence against women. A sociological perspective tells us that cultural myths and economic and gender inequality help lead to rape, and that the rape problem goes far beyond a few psychopathic men who rape women. A sociological perspective thus tells us that our society cannot just stop at doing something about these men. Instead it must make more far-reaching changes by changing people’s beliefs about rape and by making every effort to reduce poverty and to empower women. This last task is especially important, for, as Randall and Haskell (1995, p. 22)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn04_080">Randall, M., &amp; Haskell, L. (1995). Sexual violence in women’s lives: Findings from the women’s safety project, a community-based survey. <em class="emphasis">Violence Against Women, 1</em>, 6–31.</span> observed, a sociological perspective on rape “means calling into question the organization of sexual inequality in our society.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s06_s01_p02">Aside from this fundamental change, other remedies, such as additional and better funded rape-crisis centers, would help women who experience rape and sexual assault. Yet even here women of color face an additional barrier. Because the antirape movement was begun by white, middle-class feminists, the rape-crisis centers they founded tended to be near where they live, such as college campuses, and not in the areas where women of color live, such as inner cities and Native American reservations. This meant that women of color who experienced sexual violence lacked the kinds of help available to their white, middle-class counterparts (Matthews, 1989),<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn04_081">Matthews, N. A. (1989). Surmounting a legacy: The expansion of racial diversity in a local anti-rape movement. <em class="emphasis">Gender &amp; Society, 3</em>, 518–532.</span> and despite some progress, this is still true today.</p>
