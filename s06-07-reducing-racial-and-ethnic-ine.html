    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_p01">Now that we have examined race and ethnicity in the United States, what have we found? Where do we stand in the second decade of the twenty-first century? Did the historic election of Barack Obama as president in 2008 signify a new era of equality between the races, as many observers wrote, or did his election occur despite the continued existence of pervasive racial and ethnic inequality?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_p02">On the one hand, there is cause for hope. Legal segregation is gone. The vicious, “old-fashioned” racism that was so rampant in this country into the 1960s has declined dramatically since that tumultuous time. People of color have made important gains in several spheres of life, and African Americans and other people of color occupy some important elected positions in and outside the South, a feat that would have been unimaginable a generation ago. Perhaps most notably, Barack Obama has African ancestry and identifies as an African American, and on his 2008 election night people across the country wept with joy at the symbolism of his victory. Certainly progress has been made in US racial and ethnic relations.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_p03">On the other hand, there is also cause for despair. Old-fashioned racism has been replaced by a modern, symbolic racism that still blames people of color for their problems and reduces public support for government policies to deal with their problems. Institutional discrimination remains pervasive, and hate crimes, such as the cross burning that began this chapter, remain all too common. So does suspicion of people based solely on the color of their skin, as the Trayvon Martin tragedy again reminds us.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_p04">If adequately funded and implemented, several types of programs and policies show strong promise of reducing racial and ethnic inequality. We turn to these in a moment, but first let’s discuss affirmative action, an issue that has aroused controversy since its inception.</p>
    <div class="callout block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_n02">
        <h3 class="title">People Making a Difference</h3>
        <p class="simpara">College Students and the Southern Civil Rights Movement</p>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_p05">The first chapter of this book included this famous quotation by anthropologist Margaret Mead: “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” The beginnings of the Southern civil rights movement provide an inspirational example of Mead’s wisdom and remind us that young people can make a difference.</p>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_p06">Although there had been several efforts during the 1950s by African Americans to end legal segregation in the South, the start of the civil rights movement is commonly thought to have begun on February 1, 1960. On that historic day, four brave African American students from the Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina, dressed in coats and ties, sat down quietly at a segregated lunch counter in a Woolworth’s store in the city of Greensboro and asked to be served. When they were refused service, they stayed until the store closed at the end of the day, and then went home. They returned the next day and were joined by some two dozen other students. They were again refused service and sat quietly the rest of the day. The next day some sixty students and other people joined them, followed by some three hundred on the fourth day. Within a week, sit-ins were occurring at lunch counters in several other towns and cities inside and outside of North Carolina. In late July, 1960, the Greensboro Woolworth’s finally served African Americans, and the entire Woolworth’s chain desegregated its lunch counters a day later. Although no one realized it at the time, the civil rights movement had “officially” begun thanks to the efforts of a small group of college students.</p>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_p07">During the remaining years of the heyday of the civil rights movement, college students from the South and North joined thousands of other people in sit-ins, marches, and other activities to end legal segregation. Thousands were arrested, and at least forty-one were murdered. By risking their freedom and even their lives, they made a difference for millions of African Americans. And it all began when a small group of college students sat down at a lunch counter in Greensboro and politely refused to leave until they were served.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Affirmative Action</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Affirmative action</a><span class="glossdef">Special consideration for minorities and women in employment and education to compensate for the discrimination and lack of opportunities they experience in the larger society.</span></span> refers to special consideration for minorities and women in employment and education to compensate for the discrimination and lack of opportunities they experience in the larger society. Affirmative action programs were begun in the 1960s to provide African Americans and, later, other people of color and women access to jobs and education to make up for past discrimination. President John F. Kennedy was the first known official to use the term, when he signed an executive order in 1961 ordering federal contractors to “take affirmative action” in ensuring that applicants are hired and treated without regard to their race and national origin. Six years later, President Lyndon B. Johnson added sex to race and national origin as demographic categories for which affirmative action should be used.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s01_p02">Although many affirmative action programs remain in effect today, court rulings, state legislation, and other efforts have limited their number and scope. Despite this curtailment, affirmative action continues to spark much controversy, with scholars, members of the public, and elected officials all holding strong views on the issue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s01_p03">One of the major court rulings just mentioned was the US Supreme Court’s decision in <em class="emphasis">Regents of the University of California v. Bakke</em>, 438 US 265 (1978). Allan Bakke was a 35-year-old white man who had twice been rejected for admission into the medical school at the University of California, Davis. At the time he applied, UC–Davis had a policy of reserving sixteen seats in its entering class of one hundred for qualified people of color to make up for their underrepresentation in the medical profession. Bakke’s college grades and scores on the Medical College Admission Test were higher than those of the people of color admitted to UC–Davis either time Bakke applied. He sued for admission on the grounds that his rejection amounted to reverse racial discrimination on the basis of his being white (Stefoff, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_078">Stefoff, R. (2005). <em class="emphasis">The Bakke case: Challenging affirmative action</em>. New York, NY: Marshall Cavendish Benchmark.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s01_p04">The case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which ruled 5–4 that Bakke must be admitted into the UC–Davis medical school because he had been unfairly denied admission on the basis of his race. As part of its historic but complex decision, the Court thus rejected the use of strict racial quotas in admission, as it declared that no applicant could be excluded based solely on the applicant’s race. At the same time, however, the Court also declared that race may be used as one of the several criteria that admissions committees consider when making their decisions. For example, if an institution desires racial diversity among its students, it may use race as an admissions criterion along with other factors such as grades and test scores.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s01_p05">Two more recent Supreme Court cases both involved the University of Michigan: <em class="emphasis">Gratz v. Bollinger</em>, 539 US 244 (2003), which involved the university’s undergraduate admissions, and <em class="emphasis">Grutter v. Bollinger</em>, 539 US 306 (2003), which involved the university’s law school admissions. In <em class="emphasis">Grutter</em> the Court reaffirmed the right of institutions of higher education to take race into account in the admissions process. In <em class="emphasis">Gratz</em>, however, the Court invalidated the university’s policy of awarding additional points to high school students of color as part of its use of a point system to evaluate applicants; the Court said that consideration of applicants needed to be more individualized than a point system allowed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s01_p06">Drawing on these Supreme Court rulings, then, affirmative action in higher education admissions on the basis of race/ethnicity is permissible as long as it does not involve a rigid quota system and as long as it does involve an individualized way of evaluating candidates. Race may be used as one of several criteria in such an individualized evaluation process, but it must not be used as the only criterion.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Debate over Affirmative Action</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s01_s01_p01">Opponents of affirmative action cite several reasons for opposing it (Connors, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_079">Connors, P. (Ed.). (2009). <em class="emphasis">Affirmative action</em>. Farmington Hills, MI: Greenhaven Press.</span> Affirmative action, they say, is reverse discrimination and, as such, is both illegal and immoral. The people benefiting from affirmative action are less qualified than many of the whites with whom they compete for employment and college admissions. In addition, opponents say, affirmative action implies that the people benefiting from it need extra help and thus are indeed less qualified. This implication stigmatizes the groups benefiting from affirmative action.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s01_s01_p02">In response, proponents of affirmative action give several reasons for favoring it (Connors, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_080">Connors, P. (Ed.). (2009). <em class="emphasis">Affirmative action</em>. Farmington Hills, MI: Greenhaven Press.</span> Many say it is needed to make up not just for past discrimination and a lack of opportunities for people of color but also for ongoing discrimination and a lack of opportunity. For example, because of their social networks, whites are much better able than people of color to find out about and to get jobs (Reskin, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_081">Reskin, B. F. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Realities of affirmative action in employment</em>. Washington, DC: American Sociological Association.</span> If this is true, people of color are automatically at a disadvantage in the job market, and some form of affirmative action is needed to give them an equal chance at employment. Proponents also say that affirmative action helps add diversity to the workplace and to the campus. Many colleges, they note, give some preference to high school students who live in a distant state in order to add needed diversity to the student body; to “legacy” students—those with a parent who went to the same institution—to reinforce alumni loyalty and to motivate alumni to donate to the institution; and to athletes, musicians, and other applicants with certain specialized talents and skills. If all these forms of preferential admission make sense, proponents say, it also makes sense to take students’ racial and ethnic backgrounds into account as admissions officers strive to have a diverse student body.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s01_s01_p03">Proponents add that affirmative action has indeed succeeded in expanding employment and educational opportunities for people of color, and that individuals benefiting from affirmative action have generally fared well in the workplace or on the campus. In this regard research finds that African American students graduating from selective US colleges and universities after being admitted under affirmative action guidelines are slightly <em class="emphasis">more</em> likely than their white counterparts to obtain professional degrees and to become involved in civic affairs (Bowen &amp; Bok, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_082">Bowen, W. G., &amp; Bok, D. C. (1998). <em class="emphasis">The shape of the river: Long-term consequences of considering race in college and university admissions</em>. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s01_s01_p04">As this brief discussion indicates, several reasons exist for and against affirmative action. A cautious view is that affirmative action may not be perfect but that some form of it is needed to make up for past and ongoing discrimination and lack of opportunity in the workplace and on the campus. Without the extra help that affirmative action programs give disadvantaged people of color, the discrimination and other difficulties they face are certain to continue.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s02_p01">As indicated near the beginning of this chapter, one message from DNA evidence and studies of evolution is that we are all part of one human race. If we fail to recognize this lesson, we are doomed to repeat the experiences of the past, when racial and ethnic hostility overtook good reason and subjected people who happened to look different from the white majority to legal, social, and violent oppression. In the democracy that is America, we must try to do better so that there will truly be “liberty and justice for all.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s07_s02_p02">As the United States attempts, however haltingly, to reduce racial and ethnic inequality, sociology has much insight to offer in its emphasis on the structural basis for this inequality. This emphasis strongly indicates that racial and ethnic inequality has much less to do with any personal faults of people of color than with the structural obstacles they face, including ongoing discrimination and lack of opportunity. Efforts aimed at such obstacles, then, are in the long run essential to reducing racial and ethnic inequality (Danziger, Reed, &amp; Brown, 2004; Syme, 2008; Walsh, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_083">Danziger, S., Reed, D., &amp; Brown, T. N. (2004). <em class="emphasis">Poverty and prosperity: Prospects for reducing racial economic disparities in the United States</em>.

Helping or hurting: Are adolescent intervention programs minimizing racial inequality? <em class="emphasis">Education &amp; Urban Society, 43</em>(3), 370–395.</span> Some of these efforts resemble those for reducing poverty discussed in <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch02#barkansoc_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Poverty"</a>, given the greater poverty of many people of color, and include the following:</p>
