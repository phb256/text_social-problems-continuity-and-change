    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_p01">Regardless of its causes, poverty has devastating consequences for the people who live in it. Much research conducted and/or analyzed by scholars, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations has documented the effects of poverty (and near poverty) on the lives of the poor (Lindsey, 2009; Moore, Redd, Burkhauser, Mbawa, &amp; Collins, 2009; Ratcliffe &amp; McKernan, 2010; Sanders, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_046">Lindsey, D.

Although only 1 percent of children who are never poor end up being poor as young adults, 32 percent of poor children become poor as young adults (Ratcliffe &amp; McKernan, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_047">Ratcliffe, C., &amp; McKernan, S.-M.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p01">The poor are at greater risk for family problems, including divorce and domestic violence. As <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch09#barkansoc_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Sexual Behavior"</a> explains, a major reason for many of the problems families experience is stress. Even in families that are not poor, running a household can cause stress, children can cause stress, and paying the bills can cause stress. Families that are poor have more stress because of their poverty, and the ordinary stresses of family life become even more intense in poor families. The various kinds of family problems thus happen more commonly in poor families than in wealthier families. Compounding this situation, when these problems occur, poor families have fewer resources than wealthier families to deal with these problems.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Getting under Children’s Skin: The Biological Effects of Childhood Poverty</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p02">As the text discusses, childhood poverty often has lifelong consequences. Poor children are more likely to be poor when they become adults, and they are at greater risk for antisocial behavior when young, and for unemployment, criminal behavior, and other problems when they reach adolescence and young adulthood.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p03">According to growing evidence, one reason poverty has these consequences is that it has certain neural effects on poor children that impair their cognitive abilities and thus their behavior and learning potential. As Greg J. Duncan and Katherine Magnuson (2011, p. 23)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_049">Duncan, G. J., &amp; Magnuson, K. (2011, winter). The long reach of early childhood poverty. <em class="emphasis">Pathways: A Magazine on Poverty, Inequality, and Social Policy</em>, 22–27.</span> observe, “Emerging research in neuroscience and developmental psychology suggests that poverty early in a child’s life may be particularly harmful because the astonishingly rapid development of young children’s brains leaves them sensitive (and vulnerable) to environmental conditions.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p04">In short, poverty can change the way the brain develops in young children. The major reason for this effect is stress. Children growing up in poverty experience multiple stressful events: neighborhood crime and drug use; divorce, parental conflict, and other family problems, including abuse and neglect by their parents; parental financial problems and unemployment; physical and mental health problems of one or more family members; and so forth. Their great levels of stress in turn affect their bodies in certain harmful ways. As two poverty scholars note, “It’s not just that poverty-induced stress is mentally taxing. If it’s experienced early enough in childhood, it can in fact get ‘under the skin’ and change the way in which the body copes with the environment and the way in which the brain develops. These deep, enduring, and sometimes irreversible physiological changes are the very human price of running a high-poverty society” (Grusky &amp; Wimer, 2011, p. 2).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_050">Grusky, D., &amp; Wimer, C.(Eds.). (2011, winter). Editors’ note. <em class="emphasis">Pathways: A Magazine on Poverty, Inequality, and Social Policy</em>, 2.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p05">One way poverty gets “under children’s skin” is as follows (Evans, Brooks-Gunn, &amp; Klebanov, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_051">Evans, G. W., Brooks-Gunn, J., &amp; Klebanov, P. K. (2011, winter). Stressing out the poor: Chronic physiological stress and the income-achievement gap. <em class="emphasis">Pathways: A Magazine on Poverty, Inequality, and Social Policy</em>, 16–21.</span> Poor children’s high levels of stress produce unusually high levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and higher levels of blood pressure. Because these high levels impair their neural development, their memory and language development skills suffer. This result in turn affects their behavior and learning potential. For other physiological reasons, high levels of stress also affect the immune system, so that poor children are more likely to develop various illnesses during childhood and to have high blood pressure and other health problems when they grow older, and cause other biological changes that make poor children more likely to end up being obese and to have drug and alcohol problems.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s01_p06">The policy implications of the scientific research on childhood poverty are clear. As public health scholar Jack P. Shonkoff (2011, p. 12)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_052">Shonkoff, J. P. (2011, winter). Building a foundation for prosperity on the science of early childhood development. <em class="emphasis">Pathways: A Magazine on Poverty, Inequality, and Social Policy</em>, 10–14.</span> explains, “Viewing this scientific evidence within a biodevelopmental framework points to the particular importance of addressing the needs of our most disadvantaged children at the earliest ages.” Duncan and Magnuson (2011, p. 27)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_053">Duncan, G. J., &amp; Magnuson, K. (2011, winter). The long reach of early childhood poverty. <em class="emphasis">Pathways: A Magazine on Poverty, Inequality, and Social Policy</em>, 22–27.</span> agree that “greater policy attention should be given to remediating situations involving deep and persistent poverty occurring early in childhood.” To reduce poverty’s harmful physiological effects on children, Skonkoff advocates efforts to promote strong, stable relationships among all members of poor families; to improve the quality of the home and neighborhood physical environments in which poor children grow; and to improve the nutrition of poor children. Duncan and Magnuson call for more generous income transfers to poor families with young children and note that many European democracies provide many kinds of support to such families. The recent scientific evidence on early childhood poverty underscores the importance of doing everything possible to reduce the harmful effects of poverty during the first few years of life.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Health, Illness, and Medical Care</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s02_p01">The poor are also more likely to have many kinds of health problems, including infant mortality, earlier adulthood mortality, and mental illness, and they are also more likely to receive inadequate medical care. Poor children are more likely to have inadequate nutrition and, partly for this reason, to suffer health, behavioral, and cognitive problems. These problems in turn impair their ability to do well in school and land stable employment as adults, helping to ensure that poverty will persist across generations. Many poor people are uninsured or underinsured, at least until the US health-care reform legislation of 2010 takes full effect a few years from now, and many have to visit health clinics that are overcrowded and understaffed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s02_p02">As <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch12#barkansoc_1.0-ch12">Chapter 12 "Work and the Economy"</a> discusses, it is unclear how much of poor people’s worse health stems from their lack of money and lack of good health care versus their own behavior such as smoking and eating unhealthy diets. Regardless of the exact reasons, however, the fact remains that poor health is a major consequence of poverty. According to recent research, this fact means that poverty is responsible for almost 150,000 deaths annually, a figure about equal to the number of deaths from lung cancer (Bakalar, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_054">Bakalar, N.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Education</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s03_p01">Poor children typically go to rundown schools with inadequate facilities where they receive inadequate schooling. They are much less likely than wealthier children to graduate from high school or to go to college. Their lack of education in turn restricts them and their own children to poverty, once again helping to ensure a vicious cycle of continuing poverty across generations. As <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch10#barkansoc_1.0-ch10">Chapter 10 "The Changing Family"</a> explains, scholars debate whether the poor school performance of poor children stems more from the inadequacy of their schools and schooling versus their own poverty. Regardless of exactly why poor children are more likely to do poorly in school and to have low educational attainment, these educational problems are another major consequence of poverty.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Housing and Homelessness</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s04_p01">The poor are, not surprisingly, more likely to be homeless than the nonpoor but also more likely to live in dilapidated housing and unable to buy their own homes. Many poor families spend more than half their income on rent, and they tend to live in poor neighborhoods that lack job opportunities, good schools, and other features of modern life that wealthier people take for granted. The lack of adequate housing for the poor remains a major national problem. Even worse is outright homelessness. An estimated 1.6 million people, including more than 300,000 children, are homeless at least part of the year (Lee, Tyler, &amp; Wright, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_055">Lee, B., Tyler, K.

That chapter will outline several reasons for this dual connection between poverty and street crime, but they include the deep frustration and stress of living in poverty and the fact that many poor people live in high-crime neighborhoods. In such neighborhoods, children are more likely to grow up under the influence of older peers who are already in gangs or otherwise committing crime, and people of any age are more likely to become crime victims. Moreover, because poor and near-poor people are more likely to commit street crime, they also comprise most of the people arrested for street crimes, convicted of street crime, and imprisoned for street crime. Most of the more than 2 million people now in the nation’s prisons and jails come from poor or near-poor backgrounds. Criminal behavior and criminal victimization, then, are other major consequences of poverty.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Poverty and Poverty Policy in Other Western Democracies</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s05_p02">To compare international poverty rates, scholars commonly use a measure of the percentage of households in a nation that receive less than half of the nation’s median household income after taxes and cash transfers from the government. In data from the late 2000s, 17.3 percent of US households lived in poverty as defined by this measure. By comparison, other Western democracies had the rates depicted in the figure that follows. The average poverty rate of the nations in the figure excluding the United States is 9.5 percent. The US rate is thus almost twice as high as the average for all the other democracies.</p>

            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s05_p03">Why is there so much more poverty in the United States than in its Western counterparts? Several differences between the United States and the other nations stand out (Brady, 2009; Russell, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_056">Brady, D. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Rich democracies, poor people: How politics explain poverty</em>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press; Russell, J. W. ( 2011). <em class="emphasis">Double standard: Social policy in Europe and the United States</em> (2nd ed.). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.</span> First, other Western nations have higher minimum wages and stronger labor unions than the United States has, and these lead to incomes that help push people above poverty. Second, these other nations spend a much greater proportion of their gross domestic product on social expenditures (income support and social services such as child-care subsidies and housing allowances) than does the United States. As sociologist John Iceland (2006, p. 136)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_057">Iceland, J. (2006). <em class="emphasis">Poverty in America: A handbook</em>. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.</span> notes, “Such countries often invest heavily in both universal benefits, such as maternity leave, child care, and medical care, and in promoting work among [poor] families…The United States, in comparison with other advanced nations, lacks national health insurance, provides less publicly supported housing, and spends less on job training and job creation.” Block and colleagues agree: “These other countries all take a more comprehensive government approach to combating poverty, and they assume that it is caused by economic and structural factors rather than bad behavior” (Block et al., 2006, p. 17).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_058">Block, F., Korteweg, A. C., &amp; Woodward, K. (2006). The compassion gap in American poverty policy. <em class="emphasis">Contexts, 5</em>(2), 14–20.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s05_p04">The experience of the United Kingdom provides a striking contrast between the effectiveness of the expansive approach used in other wealthy democracies and the inadequacy of the American approach. In 1994, about 30 percent of British children lived in poverty; by 2009, that figure had fallen by more than half to 12 percent. Meanwhile, the US 2009 child poverty rate, was almost 21 percent.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s05_p05">Britain used three strategies to reduce its child poverty rate and to help poor children and their families in other ways. First, it induced more poor parents to work through a series of new measures, including a national minimum wage higher than its US counterpart and various tax savings for low-income workers. Because of these measures, the percentage of single parents who worked rose from 45 percent in 1997 to 57 percent in 2008. Second, Britain increased child welfare benefits regardless of whether a parent worked. Third, it increased paid maternity leave from four months to nine months, implemented two weeks of paid paternity leave, established universal preschool (which both helps children’s cognitive abilities and makes it easier for parents to afford to work), increased child-care aid, and made it possible for parents of young children to adjust their working hours to their parental responsibilities (Waldfogel, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_059">Waldfogel, J. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Britain’s war on poverty</em>. New York, NY: Russell Sage Foundation.</span> While the British child poverty rate fell dramatically because of these strategies, the US child poverty rate stagnated.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch02_s04_s05_p06">In short, the United States has so much more poverty than other democracies in part because it spends so much less than they do on helping the poor. The United States certainly has the wealth to follow their example, but it has chosen not to do so, and a high poverty rate is the unfortunate result. As the Nobel laureate economist Paul Krugman (2006, p. A25)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn02_060">Krugman, P. (2006, December 25). Helping the poor, the British way. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. A25.</span> summarizes this lesson, “Government truly can be a force for good. Decades of propaganda have conditioned many Americans to assume that government is always incompetent…But the [British experience has] shown that a government that seriously tries to reduce poverty can achieve a lot.”</p>
