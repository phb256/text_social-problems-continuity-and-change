    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_p01">One of the most significant changes over the centuries has been <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">urbanization</a><span class="glossdef">The rise and growth of cities.</span></span>, or the shift from rural areas to large cities. Urbanization has had important consequences for many aspects of social, political, and economic life (Kleniewski &amp; Thomas, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_002">Kleniewski, N., &amp; Thomas, A. R. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Cities, change, and conflict</em> (4th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_p02">The earliest cities developed in ancient times after the rise of horticultural and pastoral societies made it possible for people to stay in one place instead of having to move around to find food. Because ancient cities had no sanitation facilities, people typically left their garbage and human waste in the city streets or just outside the city wall (which most cities had for protection from possible enemies). This poor sanitation led to rampant disease and high death rates. Some cities eventually developed better sanitation procedures, including, in Rome, a sewer system. Still, the world remained largely rural until the industrialization of the nineteenth century. We return to industrialization shortly.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_p03">During the American colonial period, cities along the eastern seaboard were the centers of commerce and politics. Boston, New York, and Philadelphia were the three largest cities in population size. Yet they were tiny in comparison to their size today. In 1790, the year after George Washington became the first president of the new nation, New York’s population was only 33,131; Philadelphia’s was 28,522; and Boston’s was 18,230 (Gibson, 1998).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_003">Gibson, C. (1998). <em class="emphasis">Population of the 100 largest cities and other urban places in the United States: 1790–1990</em>. Washington, DC: US Census Bureau.</span> Today, of course, cities of this size are called small towns. New York’s population is vastly higher, at about 8.2 million; Philadelphia’s is 1.5 million; and Boston’s is 618, 000.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_p04">US cities became more numerous and much larger during the nineteenth century because of two trends. The first was immigration, as waves of immigrants from Ireland and then Italy and other nations began coming to the United States during the 1820s. The second was industrialization, as people moved to live near factories and other sites of industrial production. These two trends were momentous: People crowded together as never before, and they crowded into living conditions that were often squalid. Lack of sanitation continued to cause rampant disease, and death rates from cholera, typhoid, and other illnesses were high.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_p05">Crime also became a significant problem, as did riots and other mob violence beginning in the 1830s. This type of mass violence was so common that the 1830s have been called the “turbulent era” (Feldberg, 1980).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_004">Feldberg, M. (1980). <em class="emphasis">The turbulent era: Riot and disorder in Jacksonian America</em>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> Most of this mass violence was committed by native-born whites against African Americans, Catholics, and immigrants. Native whites resented their presence and were deeply prejudiced against them. During the three decades beginning in 1830, almost three-fourths of US cities with populations above 20,000 had at least one riot. This wave of mass violence in the nation’s cities led Abraham Lincoln to lament, “Accounts of outrages committed by mobs form the everyday news of the times…Whatever their causes be, it is common to the whole country” (Barkan &amp; Snowden, 2008, p. 34).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_005">Barkan, S. E., &amp; Snowden, L. L. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Collective violence</em>. Cornwall-on-Hudson, NY: Sloan.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_p06">American cities grew even more rapidly after the Civil War as both industrialization and immigration continued. By the early years of the twentieth century, US cities on the East Coast were almost unimaginably crowded, and their living conditions continued to be wretched for many of their residents. Their city governments, police forces, and business worlds were also notoriously corrupt. In 1904, Lincoln Steffens, a renowned “muckraking” journalist, published his classic work, <em class="emphasis">The Shame of the Cities</em> (Steffens, 1904),<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_006">Steffens, L. (1904). <em class="emphasis">The shame of the cities</em>. New York, NY: McClure, Phillips.</span> which was a collection of six articles he had written for <em class="emphasis">McClure’s Magazine</em>. In this book, Steffens used biting prose to attack the municipal corruption of the times in Chicago, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and other cities. In the original articles that compose the book, he named names: He listed by name people who gave and received bribes and those who were corrupt in other ways. A decade earlier, another muckraker, Jacob Riis, had published <em class="emphasis">How the Other Half Lives: Studies among the Tenements of New York</em> (Riis, 1890),<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_007">Riis, J. (1890). <em class="emphasis">How the other half lives: Studies among the tenements of New York</em>. New York. NY: Charles Scribner’s Sons.</span> a book of searing photographs of poverty in the largest US city. The books by Steffens and Riis remain as vivid reminders of what cities were like a century ago, and perhaps are still like today in some respects.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_p07">As Americans moved west after the Civil War and during the twentieth century, western cities appeared almost overnight and expanded the pace of urbanization. Continued industrialization, immigration, and general population growth further increased the number and size of US cities. Internal migration had a similar impact, as waves of African Americans moved from the South to Chicago and other northern cities.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_p09">Note that the populations of New York and Chicago show some decline after 1950. This decline reflects two other trends affecting cities in the past half-century: (1) the movement of people from cities to suburbs; and (2) the movement of Americans from northern cities to southern and southwestern cities. Reflecting this second trend, and also reflecting increases in immigration from Mexico and Asia, southern and southwestern cities have grown rapidly during the past few decades. For example, during the 1970–2010 period, the populations of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Phoenix, Arizona, more than doubled, while the populations of Cleveland, Ohio, and Detroit, Michigan, both fell by about half (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_f02">Figure 14.2 "Population Change from 1970 to 2010 for Selected Cities"</a>).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Global Urbanization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p01">If the United States has urbanized during the last two centuries, so has much of the rest of the world. Only 3 percent of the world’s population lived in urban areas in 1800. By a century later in 1900, 14 percent of the world’s population lived in urban areas, and twelve cities had populations over 1 million. Just a half-century later in 1950, the world’s urban population had doubled to 30 percent, and the number of cities over 1 million grew six times to eighty-three cities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p02">Today, more than half the world’s population lives in urban areas, and the number of cities over 1 million stands at more than four hundred. By 2030, almost two-thirds of the world’s population is projected to live in urban areas. The number of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">megacities</a><span class="glossdef">Cities with populations over 10 million.</span></span>—cities with populations over 10 million—rose from three in 1975 to sixteen in 2000, and is expected to reach twenty-seven by 2025 (Population Reference Bureau, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_008">Population Reference Bureau.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p03">Despite all this growth, the degree of urbanization still varies around the world (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_f01">Figure 14.4 "Percentage of World Population Living in Urban Areas"</a>). In general, wealthy nations are more urban than poor nations, thanks in large part to the latter’s rural economies. Still, urbanization in poor nations is proceeding rapidly. Most megacities are now in, and will continue to be in, nations that are relatively poor or desperately poor. The number of urban residents in these nations will increase greatly in the years ahead as people there move to urban areas and as their populations continue to grow through natural fertility. Fertility is a special problem in this regard for two reasons. First, women in poor nations have high fertility rates. Second, poor nations have very high proportions of young people, and these high rates mean that many births occur because of the large number of women in their childbearing years.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p04">Rapid urbanization poses both opportunities and challenges for poor nations. The opportunities are many. Jobs are more plentiful in cities than in rural areas and incomes are higher, and services such as health care and schooling are easier to deliver because people are living more closely together. In another advantage, women in poor nations generally fare better in cities than in rural areas in terms of education and employment possibilities (United Nations Population Fund, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_009">United Nations Population Fund.

As the United Nations Population Fund (2007)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_010">United Nations Population Fund. (2007). Linking population, poverty, and development.

As cities grow rapidly in poor nations, moreover, these nations’ poverty makes them ill equipped to meet the challenges of urbanization. Helping these nations meet the needs of their cities remains a major challenge for the world community in the years ahead. In this regard, the United Nations Population Fund (2007)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_011">United Nations Population Fund. (2007). Linking population, poverty, and development.

A roof and an address in a habitable area are the first step to a better life. Improving access to basic social and health services, including reproductive health care, for poor people in urban slums is also critical to breaking the cycle of poverty.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p06">Life in the megacity of Mumbai (formerly called Bombay) in India illustrates many of the problems facing large cities in poor nations. Mumbai’s population exceeds 12.4 million, with another 8 million living in the greater metropolitan area; this total of more than 20 million ranks Mumbai’s metropolitan population as the fourth highest in the world. An author who grew up in Mumbai calls his city an “urban catastrophe.” He continued, “Bombay is the future of urban civilization on the planet.
