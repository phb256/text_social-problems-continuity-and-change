    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch05_s04_p01">The inequality arising from sexual orientation stems from long-standing and deep-rooted prejudice against nonheterosexual attraction and behavior and against the many people whose sexual orientation is not heterosexual. We have seen in this chapter that attitudes about and related to same-sex sexuality have become markedly more positive since a generation ago. Reflecting this trend, the number of openly gay elected officials and candidates for office has increased greatly since a generation ago, and the sexual orientation of candidates appears to be a nonissue in many areas of the nation (Page, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn05_073">Page, S. (2011, July 20). Gay candidates gain acceptance. <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/index">http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/index</a>.</span> In a 2011 Gallup poll, two-thirds of Americans said they would vote for a gay candidate for president, up from only one-fourth of Americans in 1978 (Page, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn05_074">Page, S.

Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/index">http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/index</a>.</span> Also in 2011, the US Senate confirmed the nomination of the first openly gay man for a federal judgeship (Milbank, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn05_075">Milbank, D. (2011, July 18). In a “quiet moment,” gay judge makes history. <em class="emphasis">The Washington Post</em>. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/">http://www.washingtonpost.com/</a>.</span> To paraphrase the slogan of a nationwide campaign aimed at helping gay teens deal with bullying and other mistreatment, it is getting better.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch05_s04_p02">Much of this improvement must be credited to the gay rights movement that is popularly thought to have begun in June 1969 in New York City after police raided a gay bar called the Stonewall Inn and arrested several people inside. A crowd of several hundred people gathered and rioted in protest that night and the next night. The gay rights movement had begun.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch05_s04_p03">Despite the advances this movement has made and despite the improvement in public attitudes about LGBT issues, we have seen in this chapter that LGBT people continue to experience many types of inequality and other problems. As with inequality based on race and/or ethnicity, social class, and gender, there is much work still to be done to reduce inequality based on sexual orientation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch05_s04_p04">For such inequality to be reduced, it is certainly essential that heterosexuals do everything possible in their daily lives to avoid any form of mistreatment of LGBT individuals and to treat them as they would treat any heterosexual. Beyond this, certain other measures should help address LGBT inequality. These measures might include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch05_s04_l02">
        <li>Parents should make clear to their children that all sexual orientations are equally valid. Parents whose child happens to be LGBT should love that child at least as much as they would love a heterosexual child.</li>
        <li>School programs should continue and strengthen their efforts to provide students a positive environment in regard to sexual orientation and to educate them about LGBT issues. Bullying and other harassment of LGBT students must not be tolerated. In 2011, California became the first state to require the teaching of gay and lesbian history; other states should follow this example.</li>
        <li>Federal law should prohibit employment discrimination against LGBT people, and same-sex marriages should become legal throughout the United States. In the meantime, new legislation should provide same-sex couples the same rights, responsibilities, and benefits that heterosexual married couples have.</li>
        <li>Police should continue to educate themselves about LGBT issues and should strengthen their efforts to ensure that physical attacks on LGBT people are treated at least as seriously as attacks on heterosexual people are treated.</li>
