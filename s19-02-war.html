        <h2 class="title editable block">The World at War</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_p01">More than 100 million soldiers and civilians are estimated to have died during the international and civil wars of the twentieth century (Leitenberg, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_016">Leitenberg, M. (2006). <em class="emphasis">Deaths in wars and conflicts in the 20th century</em>. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Peace Studies Program.</span> Although this is almost an unimaginable number, there is cause for some hope, even as there is also cause for despair.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_p02">The hope arises from historical evidence that the number of international wars, civil wars, and other types of armed conflict has in fact declined over the centuries, with the number in the past half-century much smaller than in centuries past (Pinker, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_017">Pinker, S. (2012). <em class="emphasis">The better angels of our nature: Why violence has declined</em>. New York, NY: Penguin.</span> Reflecting this decline, a smaller percentage of the world’s population died in armed conflict during the past century than in earlier eras.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_p03">To illustrate this trend, compare two periods of history (Pinker, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_018">Pinker, S. (2012). <em class="emphasis">The better angels of our nature: Why violence has declined</em>. New York, NY: Penguin.</span> The first is the thirteenth century, when the Mongol Empire under the initial leadership of Genghis Khan became an empire in Asia and Eastern Europe through wars and conquest in which it killed 40 million people. The second period is 1939–1945, when World War II killed 55 million people. Although 55 million is more than 40 million, the world’s population in the thirteenth century was only one-seventh its population during the World War II period. A quick calculation shows that about 11 percent of the world’s population died from the Mongolian wars, while 2 percent died from World War II. In terms of the risk of dying in war, then, the Mongolian wars were five times more deadly than World War II.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_p04">Looking further back in world history, the death rate in prehistoric times from tribal warfare was extremely high. If this high rate had held true during the twentieth century, 2 billion people would have died in twentieth-century wars rather than the 100 million who did die (Pinker, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_019">Pinker, S. (2012). <em class="emphasis">The better angels of our nature: Why violence has declined</em>. New York, NY: Penguin.</span> Although wars, other armed conflicts, terrorism, and genocide certainly continue, and 100 million is a terribly high number of deaths, the world overall is in fact more peaceful now than in the past.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_p05">That is the good news and the cause for hope. The cause for despair is twofold. First, war, terrorism, genocide, and other armed conflicts <em class="emphasis">do</em> continue. Even if they are less frequent and less deadly than in the past, that is of little comfort to the tens of millions of people around the world during the past century who died or otherwise suffered in war and other armed conflict and who live in fear today of becoming a victim of armed conflict.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_p06">Second, the world today is a much more dangerous place than in the past because of the existence of nuclear weapons. The thirteenth-century Mongolians killed their 40 million with battleaxes and other crude weapons; the World War II deaths resulted from gunfire and conventional bombs. At the end of that war, however, the nuclear age began when the United States dropped two atomic weapons on Japan that killed tens of thousands instantly and tens of thousands more from radiation exposure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s01_p07">Those two weapons were tiny in both number and size compared to nuclear weapons today. More than 20,000 nuclear warheads now exist; 4,800 are operational and almost 2,000 (held by the United States and Russia) are on high alert, ready to be used at any time (Federation of American Scientists, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_020">Federation of American Scientists.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s02_p01">If we say the history of the United States has been written in war, that is not too much of an exaggeration. The United States, of course, began with the colonial war against England. The American Civil War, also called the War Between the States, then tore it apart less than a century later. Between 1861 and 1865, at least 618,000 and perhaps as many as 750,000 soldiers in both the Union and the Confederacy died on the battlefield or from disease. The minimum estimate almost matches the number of American deaths in all the other wars the United States has fought, and the maximum estimate greatly exceeds this number (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s02_t01">Table 16.2 "US Participation in Major Wars"</a>).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Explaining War</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p01">The enormity of war has long stimulated scholarly interest in why humans wage war (Levy &amp; Thompson, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_024">Levy, J. S., &amp; Thompson, W. R. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Causes of war</em>. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.</span> A popular explanation for war derives from evolutionary biology. According to this argument, war is part of our genetic heritage because the humans who survived tens of thousands of years ago were those who were most able, by virtue of their temperament and physicality, to take needed resources from other humans they attacked and to defend themselves from attackers. In this manner, a genetic tendency for physical aggression and warfare developed and thus still exists today. In support of this evolutionary argument, some scientists note that chimpanzees and other primates also engage in group aggression against others of their species (Wrangham, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_025">Wrangham, R. W. (2004). Killer species. <em class="emphasis">Daedalus, 133</em>(4), 25–35.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_p02">However, other scientists dispute the evolutionary explanation for several reasons (Begley, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_026">Begley, S. (2009, June 29). Don’t blame the caveman. <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, 52–62.</span> First, the human brain is far more advanced than the brains of other primates, and genetic instincts that might drive these primates’ behavior do not necessarily drive human behavior. Second, many societies studied by anthropologists have been very peaceful, suggesting that a tendency to warfare is more cultural than biological. Third, most people are not violent, and most soldiers have to be resocialized (in boot camp or its equivalent) to overcome their deep moral convictions against killing. If warlike tendencies were part of human genetic heritage, these convictions would not exist.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_s01_p01">If warfare is not biological in origin, then it is best understood as a social phenomenon, one that has its roots in the decisions of political and military officials. Sometimes, as with the US entrance into World War II after Pearl Harbor, these decisions are sincere and based on a perceived necessity to defend a nation’s people and resources, and sometimes these decisions are based on cynicism and deceit (Solomon, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_027">Solomon, N.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_s01_p02">A prime example of this latter dynamic is the Vietnam War. The 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, in which Congress authorized President Lyndon Johnson to wage an undeclared war in Vietnam, was passed after North Vietnamese torpedo boats allegedly attacked US ships. However, later investigation revealed that the attack never occurred and that the White House lied to Congress and the American people (Wells, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_028">Wells, T. (1994). <em class="emphasis">The war within: America’s battle over Vietnam</em>. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.</span> Four decades later, questions of deceit were again raised after the United States began the war against Iraq because of its alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction. These weapons were never found, and critics charged that the White House had fabricated and exaggerated evidence of the weapons in order to win public and congressional support for the war (Danner, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_029">Danner, M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_s02_p01">Although war is a social phenomenon arising from decisions of political and military officials, other phenomena can make it more likely that these officials will decide to go to war. These more basic causes of war include population change and environmental change. As <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch15#barkansoc_1.0-ch15">Chapter 15 "Population and the Environment"</a> discussed, population growth may lead to armed conflict of various types, including war, because growing populations need more food, water, and other resources. History shows that when these resources become too scarce within a society, that society is more likely to go to war to wrest these resources from another society (Gleditsch &amp; Theisen, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_030">Gleditsch, N.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s03_s03_p01">Nations also go to war for ideological reasons: they have certain belief systems that lead them to hold prejudice and other hostile feelings toward nations with different belief systems. Religion is a very important ideology in this regard. Historically and also today, nations in the Middle East and elsewhere have gone to war or are otherwise in conflict because of religious differences. Although the causes of World War II are complex, Hitler’s effort to conquer much of Europe stemmed at least partly from his belief that Aryans (Germans and other Europeans with blond hair and blue eyes) were a superior species and non-Aryans were an inferior species (Bess, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_032">Bess, M.

The nation rightly grieved these deaths when they occurred and built monuments, such as the Korean and Vietnam veterans memorials in Washington, DC, that list the names of the dead.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p02">John Tirman, director of the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, worries that Americans have neglected the civilian victims of war. He applauds the Korean and Vietnam memorials in Washington, but he laments that “neither mentions the people of those countries who perished in the conflicts” (Tirman, 2012, p. B01).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_033">Tirman, J. (2012, January 8). Do we care when civilians die in war? <em class="emphasis">The Washington Post</em>, p.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p03">Tirman notes that approximately 6 million civilians and soldiers died in the Korean, Vietnam/Indochina, Iraq, and Afghanistan wars. Most of these victims were civilians, and most of these civilian deaths were the result of actions by the United States and its allies. These deaths stemmed from bombs and other weapons that went astray, from orders by military and political leaders to drop millions upon millions of bombs on civilian areas, and sometimes from atrocities committed by US personnel. In World War II, Tirman adds, the United States dropped two atomic bombs that killed tens of thousands of civilians, and it joined its allies in the <em class="emphasis">carpet bombing</em> of German and Japanese cities that also killed hundreds of thousands.</p>

But he also notes that the Korean and Vietnam wars included many atrocities committed by American troops against civilians. To be blunt, American troops simply shot untold hundreds of Korean and Vietnamese civilians in cold blood.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p05">Tirman describes one Korean incident in which machine gun fire from US warplanes killed about one hundred civilian refugees who were resting on a road. The remaining several hundred refugees hid and were shot at for three days by US ground soldiers. Tirman (2012, p. 107)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_035">Tirman, J. (2012, January 8). Do we care when civilians die in war? <em class="emphasis">The Washington Post</em>, p.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p06">In Vietnam, Tirman writes, American troops and planes routinely razed villages to the ground, killing villagers indiscriminately, and then evacuated any survivors. Once they were evacuated, their villages were designated “free fire zones,” and then often bombed indiscriminately once again, killing any villagers who managed to remain in these zones despite the evacuations. All these killings were outright slaughter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p07">In one example of what Tirman (2011, p. 153)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_036">Tirman, J. (2011). <em class="emphasis">The deaths of others: The fate of civilians in America’s wars</em>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> calls a typical massacre, US soldiers arrived at a village that had just been bombed and ordered surviving residents to gather at the center of the town. After they did so, US ground troops shot them and left a pile of dead bodies that included twenty-one children. As this brief discussion indicates, although the massacre of 347 Vietnamese at the hamlet of My Lai is undoubtedly the Vietnam massacre that is best known (and perhaps the only known) to the American public, massacres were far from rare and in fact were rather common.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p08">A central part of US military strategy in Vietnam involved destroying rice fields and the rest of the countryside to make it difficult for the Vietcong forces to engage in guerrilla warfare. To do so, it routinely deployed chemical weapons such as Agent Orange (dioxin, a known carcinogen), napalm, and white phosphorous. Planes sprayed and bombed these chemicals. These actions did destroy the countryside, but they also destroyed humans. The <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_n01" xrefstyle="select: label">Note 16.13 "Children and Our Future"</a> box discusses this problem in greater detail.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Children and Our Future</h3>
            <p class="simpara">“Napalm Sticks to Kids”</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p09">This book has emphasized that children are often the innocent victims of various social problems from the time they are born, with important consequences for their futures. There are also many innocent victims in wartime, but when children are victims, our hearts especially go out to them. The Vietnam War marked a time when many Americans became concerned about children’s suffering during wartime. A key focus of their concern was the use of napalm.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p10">Napalm is a very flammable jellylike substance made out of gasoline, soap, and white phosphorous. Napalm bombs were used in World War II to set fire to cities, military bunkers, and other targets. When napalm ends up on human skin, it causes incredibly severe pain and burns down to the bone, with death often resulting. Because napalm is very sticky, it is almost impossible to wipe off or remove with water once it does end up on skin.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p11">Bombs containing napalm made by Dow Chemical were routinely used by the US military and its South Vietnamese allies during the Vietnam War to defoliate the countryside and to attack various targets. Some 400,000 tons of napalm were used altogether. When a napalm bomb explodes, it ignites an enormous fireball that burns everything in its path. Inevitably, Vietnamese civilians were in the path of the fireballs generated by the US and South Vietnamese militaries. An unknown number of civilians were burned severely or, if they were lucky, died. Many antiwar protests in the United States focused on the civilian suffering from napalm. Protesters at Dow Chemical’s New York office carried signs that said, “Napalm Burns Babies, Dow Makes Money.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p12">One of these civilians was a 9-year-old girl named Phan Thi Kim Phuc. An Associated Press photo of her running naked and screaming with burns after her village was napalmed was one of the most memorable photos of that war. Although she survived, it took seventeen surgeries to turn her whole again.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s04_p13">A poem about napalm, reportedly written by members of the US First Air Cavalry, surfaced during the war. Some verses follow.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p01">The attention just given to civilians should in no way obscure or minimize the fact that veterans are also casualties of war. The Korean and Vietnam veterans’ memorials in the nation’s capital and so many other memorials across the nation remind us of the hundreds of thousands of brave men and women who have died serving their country. But veterans are casualties in other ways, as the news story that began this chapter made clear. They suffer terrible physical and mental wounds that can maim them for life (Dao, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_038">Dao, J. (2012, January 2).

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p02">Veterans of the Vietnam War came back to a nation that often did not greet them as heroes. Many came back addicted to heroin and other drugs, many were unemployed, and many became homeless. Many veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have also come back home with these problems. Their unemployment rate was 13.1 percent in December 2011, compared to only 8.5 percent for the general public; the unemployment rate for veterans ages 20–24 was near 30 percent (Dewan, 2011; Zornick, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_039">Dewan, S.

(2012, January 2). Acting out war’s inner wounds. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. A1.</span> Veterans with PTSD often end up with problems in their marriages or other relationships and are more likely to commit violence against their spouses or partners. When these problems occur, they may ironically worsen the psychological state of these veterans.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p03">A related problem is suicide. For every 100,000 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who receive health care from the Veterans Administration, 38 have killed themselves. The suicide rate of the general population is only 11.3 deaths per 100,000 population. The suicide rate of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans is thus more than three times higher than that of the general public (Martinez &amp; Bingham, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_041">Martinez, L., &amp; Bingham, A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p04">Evidence from a national survey of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans underscores the problems they face (Pew Research Center, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_042">Pew Research Center.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p05">One Iraq veteran with these problems is Tom Marcum, who came home with a brain injury, PTSD, and fits of violence and short-term memory loss. His wife April had to quit her teaching job to take care of him, and their life savings slowly dwindled. April missed the man she used to know: “The biggest loss is the loss of the man I married. His body’s here, but his mind is not here anymore. I see glimpses of him, but he’s not who he was” (Einhorn, 2011, p. A12).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_043">Einhorn, C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p06">As the Marcums’ situation indicates, spouses and other family members of veterans also are casualties of war. Indeed, the Marcums’ situation is far from rare among the families of the 2 million veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. As a news report summarized these families’ experience, “Ms. Marcum has joined a growing community of spouses, parents and partners who, confronted with damaged loved ones returning from war who can no longer do for themselves, drop most everything in their own lives to care for them. Jobs, hobbies, friends, even parental obligations to young children fall by the wayside. Families go through savings and older parents dip into retirement funds” (Einhorn, 2011, p. A12).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_044">Einhorn, C. (2011, September 28). Looking after the soldier, back home and damaged. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p07">Families of deployed troops also face many difficulties. There is the natural fear that loved ones will never return from their overseas involvement in armed conflict. This fear can take a psychological toll on all members of these families, but perhaps especially on children. One teenager recalled the tensions that arose when his father was in Iraq: “I was in eighth grade when my dad deployed to Iraq. A kid walked up to me and said, ‘Your dad’s a baby killer.’ I didn’t handle that well. We both wound up suspended for that one” (Ashton, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_045">Ashton, A. (2011, July 22).

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_p08">A recent study found that adolescents with a deployed parent are more likely than those with civilian parents to feel depressed and suicidal. They are also more likely to engage in drug use and binge drinking. Reflecting on these findings, an author of the study said, “It’s really time to focus on the children that are left behind” (Ashton, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_046">Ashton, A.

                <h3 class="title">Applying Social Research</h3>
                <p class="simpara">Determining the Prevalence of Rape and Sexual Assault in the Military</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_s01_p02">As the text discusses, most military women who are raped or sexually assaulted do not report these crimes to military authorities. As a result, reported rapes and sexual assaults compose only a very small percentage of all military rapes and sexual assaults. To get a more accurate estimate of how many such crimes occur, sound social research is necessary.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_s01_p03">Despite this need, research on sexual assault in the military was scant before the early 2000s. This type of research accelerated, however, after several scandals involving sexual assault and harassment occurred during the 1990s on military bases and at military academies. The primary mode of research involved survey questionnaires given anonymously to samples, many of them random, of military members. The samples are almost entirely of women, given their higher risk of being sexually assaulted.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_s01_p04">In these surveys, between 10 percent and 33 percent of women report being raped (including attempts) while they were serving in the military. When sexual assaults and sexual harassment are added to the crimes mentioned to respondents, between 22 percent and 84 percent of women report being raped, sexually assaulted, and/or sexually harassed while serving. Very few studies include men in their surveys, but one study reported a 3 percent rate of sexual assault victimization for men while they were in the military.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_s01_p05">One major problem in this research literature is that different studies use different definitions and measures of sexual assault. Regardless of these problems, this growing body of research documents how often rape and sexual assault in the military occur. It also documents the psychological and health effects of military sexual assault (MSA). These effects are similar to those for civilians, and include anxiety, depression, PTSD, poorer physical health, and poorer job performance (in this case, their military duties).</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_s01_p06">In shedding light on the prevalence of military rape and sexual assault and on the many negative effects of these crimes, social science research has performed an important service. Future research will no doubt build on existing studies to further illuminate this significant problem.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s05_s01_p07">Women veterans who are raped or sexually assaulted often suffer PTSD. In fact, rape and sexual assault are the leading cause of PTSD among women veterans, while combat trauma is the leading cause of PTSD among male veterans. Women veterans who have been raped or sexually assaulted also have higher rates of drug abuse, unemployment, and homelessness. One veteran recalled being gang raped by her drill sergeant and four other soldiers, who then broke several bones in her body and urinated on her. Several years later, she was still having many health problems and could not forget what happened to her. She also refused to display the American flag, saying, “When I looked at the American flag, I used to see red, white, and blue. Now, all I see is blood” (Herdy &amp; Moffeit, 2004, p. 4).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_050">Herdy, A., &amp; Moffeit, M. (2004). <em class="emphasis">Betrayal in the Ranks</em>.

Health care expenses for survivors amount to almost $1 billion annually, and the cost of prosecution amounts to $19 million annually (Stalsburg, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_051">Stalsburg, B.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Other Impacts of War</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_p01">When we think of the impact of war, the consequences for civilians and veterans as just discussed come most readily to mind. But not all civilians are affected equally. One of the many sad truisms of war is that its impact on a society is greatest when the war takes place within the society’s boundaries. For example, the Iraq war that began in 2003 involved two countries more than any others, the United States and Iraq. Because it took place in Iraq, many more Iraqis than Americans died or were wounded, and the war certainly affected Iraqi society—its infrastructure, economy, natural resources, and so forth—far more than it affected American society. Most Americans continued to live their normal lives, whereas most Iraqis had to struggle to survive the many ravages of war.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_p02">War also has impact beyond the consequences for civilians and veterans. As historians and political scientists have often described, wars have a significant economic and political impact. Many examples of this impact exist, but one well-known example involves the defeat of Germany in World War I, which led to a worsening economy during the next decade that in turn helped fuel the rise of Hitler.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_p03">War can also change a nation’s political structure in obvious ways, as when the winning nation forces a new political system and leadership on the losing nation. Other political and economic changes brought by war are less obvious. World War I again provides an interesting example of such changes. Before the war, violent labor strikes were common in Britain and other European nations. When the war began, a sort of truce developed between management and labor, as workers wanted to appear patriotic by supporting the war effort and hoped that they would win important labor rights for doing so. Although the truce later dissolved and labor-management conflict resumed, labor eventually won some limited rights thanks partly to its support for the war. As a historian summarized this connection, “By the end of the war, labor’s wartime mobilization and participation had increased its relative power within European societies. As a result, and despite the fact that endeavors to reward labor for its wartime cooperation were, in general, provisional, partial, and half-hearted, it was nonetheless the case that labor achieved some real gains” (Halperin, 2004, p. 155).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_056">Halperin, S. (2004). <em class="emphasis">War and social change in modern Europe: The great transformation revisited</em>. Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s06_p04">Other types of less obvious social changes have also resulted from various wars. For example, the deaths of so many soldiers during the American Civil War left many wives and mothers without their family’s major breadwinner. Their poverty forced many of these women to turn to prostitution to earn an income, resulting in a rise in prostitution after the war (Rafter, 1990).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_057">Rafter, N. H. (1990). <em class="emphasis">Partial justice: Women, prisons, and social control</em>. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction.</span> Some eighty years later, the involvement of African Americans in the US armed forces during World War II helped begin the racial desegregation of the military. This change is widely credited with helping spur the hopes of southern African Americans that racial desegregation would someday occur in their hometowns (McKeeby, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_058">McKeeby, D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_p01">As discussed earlier, President Eisenhower eloquently warned about the influence of the US military and the size of the military budget. The defense industry remains a powerful force in the US economy six decades after Eisenhower issued his warning, and US military spending continues unabated. In 2011, military spending (defense outlays by the Department of Defense and certain other agencies; outlays include costs for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars) according to the government was approximately $768 billion. Defense outlays rose by 85 percent beyond inflation between 2000 and 2011 (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_f01">Figure 16.2 "US Defense Outlays, 2000–2011 (Fiscal Year 2005 Dollars)"</a>).</p>

First, it excludes several military-related costs such as veterans’ benefits and interest on the national debt from past military spending. When these costs are taken into account, the <em class="emphasis">total</em> 2011 military budget ranged between an estimated $1.2 trillion and $1.4 trillion (Friends Committee on National Legislation, 2012; War Resisters League, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_059">Friends Committee on National Legislation.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_s01_p02">Second, the government states that defense outlays accounted for almost 20 percent of federal spending in 2011 (US Census Bureau, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_060">US Census Bureau.

This latter fact needs some explanation. Federal spending includes both mandatory and discretionary spending. As its name implies, <em class="emphasis">mandatory spending</em> is required by various laws and includes such things as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and interest payments on the national debt. Much of these mandatory expenses are funded by trust funds, such as Social Security taxes, which are raised and spent separately from income taxes. <em class="emphasis">Discretionary spending</em> involves the money the president and Congress must decide how to spend each year and includes federal income tax dollars only.

                <p class="simpara">Guns or Butter?</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_s02_p02">“Guns versus butter” is a macroeconomics phrase that illustrates the dilemma that nations face in deciding their spending priorities. The more they spend on their military (guns), the less they can spend on food for their poor and other domestic needs (butter).</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_s02_p03">In making this very important decision, Europe has chosen butter over guns. The wealthy European countries that compose the bulk of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an international consortium, spend 2.5 percent of their total economy (gross domestic product, or GDP) on their militaries. In contrast, the United States spends 5.1 percent of its economy on its base military budget, which does not include costs for veterans’ benefits, for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and military spending that falls outside the Pentagon’s budget.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_s02_p04">The European nations’ decisions to limit their military spending allows more spending for social needs. As a result, observes one economics writer, most Europeans have “universal health care, deeply subsidized education (including free university tuition in many countries), modern infrastructure, good mass transit, and far less poverty” than the United States has. Perhaps worse, the United States ranks last among the world’s twenty wealthiest democracies in life expectancy and infant mortality and also ranks worst in the risk of dying before age 60. In addition, half of American children need food stamps at some time before becoming adults, while this problem is far rarer in Europe.</p>

In another example, the Navy is designing a new series of nuclear submarines, with construction planned to start in 2019. The Navy plans to purchase twelve of these submarines.

Experts disagree over this issue. Some think the United States needs to maintain and in fact increase its level of military spending, even with the Cold War long ended, to replace aging weapons systems, to meet the threat posed by terrorists and by “rogue” nations such as Iran, and to respond to various other trouble spots around the world. Military spending is good for workers, they add, because it creates jobs, and it also contributes to technological development (Boot, 2012; England, 2012; McKeon, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_070">Boot, M.

They say the United States could safely decrease its nuclear and conventional weapons arsenals without at all endangering national security. They also say that the stationing of some 300,000 American troops on 865 military bases abroad at the time of this writing, including 81,000 troops in Europe and 220,000 in other nations, is hardly needed to ensure the nation’s defense. As one scholar said of the military bases, “It makes as much sense for the Pentagon to hold onto 227 military bases in Germany as it would for the post office to maintain a fleet of horses and buggies” (vanden Heuvel, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_072">vanden Heuvel, K.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_s05_p03">These experts say the military budget is bloated for at least four reasons. First, the defense industry is very effective at lobbying Congress for increased military spending, with the cozy relationship among members of the military-industrial complex helping to ensure the effectiveness of this lobbying. Second, members of Congress fear being labeled “weak on defense” if they try to reduce the military budget or do not agree to new weapons systems requested by the Pentagon. Regarding this fear, former US senator and presidential candidate George McGovern (2011, p. 47),<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_073">McGovern, G. (2011). <em class="emphasis">What it means to be a democrat</em>. New York, NY: Penguin.</span> a decorated World War II hero, writes, “We need to end the false choice between a bloated budget and a weak spine.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_s05_p04">Third, and helping to explain the success of this lobbying, military spending provides jobs and income to the home districts of members of Congress. Fourth, <em class="emphasis">military waste</em> in the form of cost overruns from poor accounting and other management failures is rampant. As just one example of such waste, a 2011 federal audit found that cost overruns over the prior two years had added at least $70 billion to projected costs of various weapons systems (Drew, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_074">Drew, C. (2011, March 30). Audit of Pentagon spending finds $70 billion in waste. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. B4.</span> A major reason for this problem was that the Pentagon had begun building these systems before their designs had been completely tested.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_s05_p05">Critics also argue that military spending actually produces fewer jobs than spending in other sectors (Ledbetter, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_075">Ledbetter, J. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Unwarranted Influence: Dwight D. Eisenhower and the military-industrial complex</em>. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.</span> According to a recent estimate, $1 billion spent by the Pentagon creates 11,200 jobs, but the same $1 billion spent in other sectors would create 16,800 clean energy jobs, 17,200 health-care jobs, and 26,700 education jobs (Pollin &amp; Garrett-Peltier, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn16_076">Pollin, R., &amp; Garrett-Peltier, H. (2011). <em class="emphasis">The US employment effects of military and domestic spending priorities: 2011 update</em>.

D. (2012). <em class="emphasis">Military spending: A poor job creator</em>. Washington, DC: Center for International Policy.</span> This report concluded that “the more money we spend on unneeded weapons programs, the more layoffs there will be of police officers, firefighters, teachers, and other workers whose jobs are funded directly or indirectly by federal spending.”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s02_s07_s05_p06">As this overview of the debate over military spending indicates, the military remains a hot topic more than two decades after the Cold War ended following the demise of the Soviet Union. As we move further into the twenty-first century, the issue of military spending will present a major challenge for US political and economic institutions to address in a way that meets America’s international and domestic interests.</p>
