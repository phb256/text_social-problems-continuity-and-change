    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_p01">The economy and the quality and quantity of work certainly affect the lives of all Americans. At the same time, work and the economy give rise to many kinds of problems that also affect millions of Americans. This section examines several of these problems.</p>
    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Loss of Jobs and Wages</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p01">Because the American economy greatly weakened as the nation went into a deep recession in late 2007, it should come as no surprise that millions of jobs have been lost during the past half-decade and that wages have declined for many Americans. Yet long before the recession began, certain ominous trends in the American economy were evident. These trends involved a general loss of jobs in many sectors of the American economy and stagnating wages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p02">These trends partly reflected the fact that the United States has joined other industrial nations in moving into a <em class="emphasis">postindustrial</em> economy. In a postindustrial economy, information technology and service jobs replace the machines and manufacturing jobs that are hallmarks of an industrial economy. If physical prowess and skill with one’s hands were prerequisites for many industrial jobs, mental prowess and communication skills are prerequisites for postindustrial jobs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p03">This move to a postindustrial economy has been a mixed blessing for many Americans. The information age has obvious benefits too numerous to mention, but there has also been a cost to the many workers whom postindustrialization and the globalization of the economy have left behind. Since the 1980s, many manufacturing companies moved their plants from US cities to sites in the developing world in Asia and elsewhere, a problem called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital flight</a><span class="glossdef">The moving of manufacturing companies from US cities to sites in the developing world in Asia and elsewhere.</span></span>. Along with the faltering economy, these trends have helped fuel a loss of 5.5 million manufacturing jobs from the American economy since 2000 (Hall, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_015">Hall, D. (2011, November 3). As the manufacturing sector goes, so goes America?

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p04">A related problem is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">outsourcing</a><span class="glossdef">The hiring by US companies of overseas workers for customer care, billing services, and other jobs that Americans used to do.</span></span>, in which US companies hire workers overseas for customer care, billing services, and other jobs that Americans used to do. China, India, and the Philippines, which have skilled workforces relatively fluent in English, are the primary nations to which US companies outsource their work. According to projections, some 3.4 million jobs will have been lost by 2015 because of outsourcing (Levine, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_016">Levine, L. (2012). <em class="emphasis">Offshoring (or offshore outsourcing) and job loss among US workers</em> (CRS Report RL32292). Retrieved January 17, 2012, from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://forbes.house.gov/UploadedFiles/CRS_-_Offshoring_and_Job_Loss_Among_U_S__Workers.pdf">http://forbes.house.gov/UploadedFiles/CRS_-_Offshoring_and_Job_Loss_Among_U_S__Workers.pdf</a>.</span> Many call centers employ workers in India, and when you call up a computer company or some other business for technical help, you might very well talk with an Indian. Because these call centers have cost Americans jobs and also because Americans and Indians often have trouble understanding each other’s accents, outsourcing has been very controversial since it became popular in the early 2000s.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p05">All these problems reflect a more general shift in the United States from goods-producing jobs to service jobs. Although some of these service jobs, such as many in the financial and computer industries, are high paying, many are in low-wage occupations, such as restaurant and clerical work, that pay less than the goods-producing jobs they replaced. Partly as a result, the average hourly wage (in 2009 dollars) in the United States for workers (excluding managers and supervisors) rose by only one dollar from $17.46 in 1979 to $18.63 in 2009. This change represented an increase of just 0.2 percent per year during that three-decade span, as workers’ wages have essentially stagnated during the last three decades (Economic Policy Institute, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_017">Economic Policy Institute. (2012). The state of working America. Retrieved January 17, 2012, from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://stateofworkingamerica.org">http://stateofworkingamerica.org</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p06">Wage changes in recent years also depend on what social class someone is in. While the average compensation of chief executive officers (CEOs) of large corporations grew by 167 percent from 1989 to 2007, the average compensation of the typical worker grew by only 10 percent (Mishel, Bernstein, &amp; Shierholz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_018">Mishel, L., Bernstein, J., &amp; Shierholz, H. (2009). <em class="emphasis">The state of working America 2008/2009</em>. Ithaca, NY: ILR Press.</span> Another way of understanding this disparity is perhaps more striking. In 1965, the average compensation of CEOs was twenty-four times greater than that of the typical worker; in 2009, their compensation was 185 times greater than that of the typical worker (Economic Policy Institute, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_019">Economic Policy Institute. (2012). The state of working America. Retrieved January 17, 2012, from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://stateofworkingamerica.org">http://stateofworkingamerica.org</a>.</span> These figures reflect growing economic inequality in the United States, a problem we further examine later in this chapter.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Decline of Labor Unions</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p01">One of the most important developments accompanying industrialization in the nineteenth century was the rise of labor unions and their conflict with management over wages and working conditions (Dubofsky &amp; Dulles, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_020">Dubofsky, M., &amp; Dulles, F. R. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Labor in America: A history</em> (8th ed.). Wheeling, IL: Harlan Davidson.</span> The pay that workers received was quite low, and the conditions in which they worked were often miserable. The typical employee worked at least ten hours a day for six or seven days a week, with almost no overtime pay and no paid vacations or holidays. To improve wages and working conditions, many labor unions were founded after the Civil War, only to meet determined opposition from companies, the government, and the courts. Companies told each other which workers were suspected of being union members, and these workers were then prevented from getting jobs. Strikers were often arrested for violating laws prohibiting strikes. When juries began finding them not guilty, employers turned to asking judges for injunctions that prohibited strikes. Workers who then went on strike were held in contempt of court by the judge as juries were kept out of the process.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p02">Labor strife also marked the Great Depression, when masses of people blamed business leaders for their economic plight. Huge sit-ins and other labor protests occurred at auto plants in Detroit. In response, the Congress passed several laws that gave workers a minimum wage, the right to join unions, a maximum-hour workweek, and other rights that Americans now take for granted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p03">Today labor unions have lost some of their influence, especially as postindustrialization has supplanted the industrial economy and as the United States has lost much of its manufacturing base. Four decades ago, about one-fourth of all private-sector nonagricultural workers belonged to labor unions. By 1985 this figure had dropped to 14.6 percent, and today it stands at only 7.2 percent (Hirsch &amp; Macpherson, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_021">Hirsch, B., &amp; Macpherson, D. (2011). Union membership and coverage database from the CPS. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://unionstats.com">http://unionstats.com</a>.</span> In response, labor unions have intensified their efforts to increase their membership, only to find that US labor laws are filled with loopholes that allow companies to prevent their workers from forming a union. For example, after a company’s workers vote to join a union, companies can appeal the vote, and it can take several years for courts to order the company to recognize the union. In the meantime, the low wages, substandard working conditions, and other factors that motivated workers to want to join a union are allowed to continue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p04">Just as the growth of unions during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries helped to raise workers’ wages, the decline of unions has lowered wages. Two reasons explain this decline (Mishel et al., 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_022">Mishel, L., Bernstein, J., &amp; Shierholz, H. (2009). <em class="emphasis">The state of working America 2008/2009</em>. Ithaca, NY: ILR Press.</span> First, union workers earn about 14 percent more than nonunion workers (controlling for experience, education, occupation, and other factors), a phenomenon known as the <em class="emphasis">union wage premium</em>. Because fewer workers are now in unions than four decades ago, they are less likely to benefit from this premium. Second, as unions have declined, there has been less pressure on nonunion employers to raise their wages to match union wages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p05">Because the union wage premium is greater for African Americans and Latinos than for whites, the wage decline caused by the decline of unions has probably been steeper for those two groups than for whites. It is also true that union workers are more likely than nonunion workers to be covered by employer-paid health insurance and also to have lower health premiums and deductibles. The decline of unions has thus meant that the average worker today is less likely to have employer-paid health insurance and, if they do, more likely to have higher premiums and deductibles.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Unemployment</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p01">Unemployment is a fact of life. There will always be people laid off or fired, who voluntarily quit their jobs, or who just graduated school and are still looking for work. But most unemployed people are involuntarily unemployed, and for them the financial and psychological consequences can be devastating, as we saw in the news story that began this chapter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p02">Unemployment rates rise and fall with the economy, and the national unemployment rate was as high as 10.2 percent in October 2009 amid the Great Recession that began almost two years earlier. It was still 8.3 percent in February 2012, amounting to almost 13 million people. But whether unemployment is high or low, it always varies by race and ethnicity, with African American and Latino unemployment rates much higher than the white rate (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_f01">Figure 12.3 "Race, Ethnicity, and Unemployment Rate, February 2012"</a>). Unemployment is also higher for younger people than for older people. In February 2012, 23.8 percent of all teenagers in the labor force (aged 16–19) were unemployed, a figure three times higher than that for adults. The unemployment rate for African Americans in this age group was a very high 34.7 percent, twice as high as the 21.3 percent figure for whites in this age group (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_023">Bureau of Labor Statistics.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p03">Unemployment figures are misleading in an important respect, as they do not include people who are <em class="emphasis">underemployed</em>. Underemployment includes the unemployed and also two other types of people: (a) those who are working part-time but who want to work full-time—the so-called <em class="emphasis">marginally attached</em>, and (b) those who have stopped looking for work because they have not been able to find a job. Many economists think that underemployment provides a more accurate measure than unemployment of the number of people with employment problems.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p04">For example, in December 2011, when the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent and 13 million people were officially unemployed, the underemployment rate was 15.2 percent, equal to 23.8 million people (Shierholz, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_024">Shierholz, H. (2012, January 6). A solid step in the right direction for the labor market.

Reflecting the racial/ethnic disparity in unemployment, 24.4 percent of African American workers and 22.3 percent of Latino workers were underemployed, compared to only 12.5 percent of white workers. Reflecting on the great amount of underemployment during the Great Recession, one economist commented, “When you combine the long-term unemployed with those who are dropping out and those who are working part time because they can’t find anything else, it is just far beyond anything we’ve seen in the job market since the 1930s” (Herbert, 2010, p. A25).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_025">Herbert, B. (2010, August 10). The horror show. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. A25.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p05">We have just seen that unemployment rises when the economy falters and that race and ethnicity affect the probability of being unemployed. These two facts provide evidence supporting the <em class="emphasis">sociological imagination</em> (see <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch01#barkansoc_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Understanding Social Problems"</a>). As C. Wright Mills (1959)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_026">Mills, C. W. (1959). <em class="emphasis">The sociological imagination</em>. London, United Kingdom: Oxford University Press.</span> emphasized in his original discussion of this concept, unemployment is best viewed more as a public issue than as a personal trouble. When so many people are unemployed during an economic recession and when there is such striking evidence of higher unemployment rates among the persons of color who have the least opportunity for the education and training needed to obtain and keep a job, it is evident that high unemployment rates reflect a public issue rather than just a collection of public troubles.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p06">Several kinds of problems make it difficult for people of color to be hired into jobs and thus contribute to the racial/ethnic disparity in unemployment.

                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p08">One problem is racial discrimination on the part of employers, regardless of how conscious employers are of their discriminatory behavior. <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch04#barkansoc_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Gender Inequality"</a> recounted a study by sociologist Devah Pager (2003),<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_027">Pager, D.

Almost one-third (31 percent) of white testers received a call back or job offer, compared to only 25.2 percent of Latino testers and 15.2 percent of African American testers.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p02">Of those who had been unemployed for at least six months (<em class="emphasis">long-term unemployment</em>), 44 percent said that the recession had caused “major changes” in their lives, versus only 20 percent of those who had never been unemployed. More than half of the long-term unemployed said their family income had declined, and more than 40 percent said that their family relations had been strained and that they had lost contact with close friends. In another finding, 38 percent said they had “lost some self-respect” from being unemployed. One-third said they were finding it difficult to pay their rent or mortgage, compared to only 16 percent of those who had never been unemployed during the recession. Half had borrowed money from family or friends to pay bills, versus only 18 percent of the never unemployed. Of all the people who had been unemployed, almost half had experienced sleep difficulties, and 5 percent had experienced drug or alcohol problems. All these numbers paint a distressing picture of the social and psychological impact of unemployment during the Great Recession that began in late 2007.</p>

                <p class="simpara">The Hidden Casualties of Unemployment</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p04">As unemployment soared in the wake of the Great Recession that began in 2007, many more children lived in a household where a parent had become unemployed. By early 2010, 11 percent of American children, or 8.1 million children overall, had an unemployed parent. Just slightly more than two years earlier, this number had been much smaller, 4.8 million. In just over two years, then, the number of children with an unemployed parent grew by two-thirds.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p05">After their parents became unemployed, these children began to suffer various psychological effects. One news report summarized this psychological impact as follows: “For many families across the country, the greatest damage inflicted by this recession has not necessarily been financial, but emotional and psychological. Children, especially, have become hidden casualties, often absorbing more than their parents are fully aware of. Several academic studies have linked parental job loss—especially that of fathers—to adverse impacts in areas like school performance and self-esteem.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p06">The emotional and psychological effects for children occur for at least two reasons. First, unemployed parents tend to experience extra stress and to become withdrawn. Second, married parents and unmarried partners often experience interpersonal conflict when one of them becomes unemployed. Both of these consequences of unemployment in turn affect children in a household where at least one parent is unemployed.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p07">Children have suffered in other ways from the rise in unemployment. More children have become homeless as their households fell into poverty. In addition, children of an unemployed parent are more likely to repeat a grade or, if they are adolescents, to drop out of school. Child abuse has probably also increased in families where a parent became unemployed.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p08">In view of all these consequences for the children of the unemployed, the United States should do everything possible to put parents and other adults back to work and to help the children of unemployed parents deal with the devastating effects of the Great Recession.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p02">Adam Smith, the founder of capitalism, envisioned that individuals would own the means of production and compete for profit, and this is the model the United States followed in its early stage of industrialization. After the Civil War, however, corporations quickly replaced individuals and their families as the owners of the means of production and as the competitors for profit. As corporations grew following the Civil War, they quickly tried to control their markets by, for example, buying up competitors and driving others out of business. To do so, they engaged in bribery, kickbacks, and complex financial schemes of dubious ethics. They also established factories and other workplaces with squalid conditions. Their shady financial practices won their chief executives the name “robber barons” and led the federal government to pass the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 designed to prohibit restraint of trade that raised prices (Hillstrom &amp; Hillstrom, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_033">Hillstrom, K., &amp; Hillstrom, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p03">More than a century later, corporations have increased in both number and size. Although several million US corporations exist, most are fairly small. Each of the largest five hundred, however, has an annual revenue exceeding $4.3 billion (2011 data) and employs thousands of workers. Their total assets run into the trillions of dollars (Fortune, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_034">Fortune. (2011). Fortune 500.

In many ways, the size and influence of corporations stifle the competition that is one of the hallmarks of capitalism. For example, several markets, including that for breakfast cereals, are controlled by four or fewer corporations. This control reduces competition because it reduces the number of products and competitors, and it thus raises prices to the public (Parenti, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_035">Parenti, M.

Often their foreign operations are in poor nations, whose low wages make them attractive sites for multinational corporation expansion. Many multinational employees in these nations work in sweatshops at very low pay and amid substandard living conditions. Critics of this practice say multinationals not only mistreat workers in poor nations but also exploit these nations’ natural resources. In contrast, defenders of the practice say multinationals are bringing jobs to poor nations and helping them achieve economic growth.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p01">In 2011, the Occupy Wall Street movement gave national attention to economic inequality by emphasizing the differences between the “1%” and the “99%.” Proclaiming “We are the 99%,” they decried the concentration of wealth in the richest of the rich and the growing inequality of the last few decades. (See <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_n01">Note 12.24 "People Making a Difference"</a>.) The issue of economic inequality merits further attention here.</p>

            <h3 class="title">People Making a Difference</h3>
            <p class="simpara">Occupy Wall Street</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p02">Before 2011, economic inequality in the United States certainly existed and in fact had increased greatly since the 1970s. However, although economic inequality was a topic of concern to social scientists, it was not a topic of concern to the general news media. Because the news media generally ignored economic inequality, it was also not a topic of concern to the general public.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p03">That all changed beginning on September 17, 2011, when hundreds of people calling themselves “Occupy Wall Street” marched through the financial district in New York City before dozens encamped overnight and for weeks to come. Occupy Wall Street took these actions to protest the role of major banks and corporations in the economic collapse of 2007 and 2008 and to call attention to their dominance over the political process. Within weeks, similar Occupy encampments had spread to more than one hundred cities in the United States and hundreds more across the globe. “We are the 99%,” they said again and again, as “occupy” became a verb heard repeatedly throughout the United States.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p04">By winter, almost all Occupy encampments had ended either because of legal crackdowns or because of the weather conditions. By that time, however, the Occupy protesters had won news media attention everywhere. In a December 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of Americans supported the Occupy Wall Street movement, while 35 percent opposed it. Almost half (48 percent) said they agreed with the concerns raised by the movement, compared to 30 percent who said they disagreed with these concerns. In the same poll, 61 percent said the US economic system “unfairly favors the wealthy,” while 36 percent said it was fair to all Americans. In a related area, 77 percent said “there is too much power in the hands of a few rich people and corporations.” In all these items, there was a notable difference by political party preference. For example, 91 percent of Democrats agreed that a few rich people and corporations have too much power, compared to 80 percent of Independents and only 53 percent of Republicans.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p05">Regardless of these political differences, Occupy Wall Street succeeded in bringing economic inequality and related issues into the national limelight. In just a few short months in 2011, it made a momentous difference.</p>

Because most societies are stratified, there will always be some people who are richer or poorer than others, but the key question is <em class="emphasis">how much</em> richer or poorer they are. When the gap between them is large, we say that much economic inequality exists; when the gap between them is small, we say that relatively little economic inequality exists.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p07">Considered in this light, the United States has a very large degree of economic inequality. A common way to examine inequality is to rank the nation’s families by income from lowest to highest and then to divide this distribution into <em class="emphasis">fifths</em>. Thus we have the poorest fifth of the nation’s families (or the 20 percent of families with the lowest family incomes), a second fifth with somewhat higher incomes, and so on until we reach the richest fifth of families, or the 20 percent with the highest incomes.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s01_p01">Economic inequality in the United States has increased during the last three decades. The loss of manufacturing jobs and unions accounts for some of this increase. However, a primary reason for the rising inequality has been tax policy. More specifically, the federal government has implemented steep cuts in the highest tax rates for income from salaries and wages and especially in tax rates for income from dividends and capital gains (Hacker &amp; Pierson, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_044">Hacker, J. S., &amp; Pierson, P. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Winner-take-all politics: How Washington made the rich richer—and turned its back on the middle class</em>. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster.</span> This latter cut is especially important because dividends and capital gains account for a much larger share of the income of wealthy families than the income of ordinary families. To be more specific, dividends and capital gains account for only 0.7 percent of the income of the bottom four-fifths of the nation’s families, but for 18.8 percent of the income of the top fifth, 38.2 percent of the top 1 percent, and a striking 51.9 percent of the top 0.1 percent (Hungerford, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_045">Hungerford, T. L. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Changes in the distribution of income among tax filers between 1996 and 2006: The role of labor income, capital income, and tax policy</em>. Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service.</span> In a related statistic, three-fourths of all capital gains are received by the top 1 percent (Krugman, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_046">Krugman, P. (2012, January 20). Taxes at the top. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p.

(2012, January 20). Why taxes aren’t as high as they seem. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. A15.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s01_p02">Keep this context in mind as we note that tax cuts in 2003 lowered the tax rate for dividends and capital gains from 28 percent to 15 percent. Meanwhile, the top tax rate for income from salaries and wages is 35 percent. Thus many very wealthy families and individuals pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than many middle- and upper-middle-class families do because so much of the wealthy families’ income is from dividends and capital gains. In fact, the four hundred wealthiest families and individuals in the country pay only about 18 percent of their income in federal tax (Krugman, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_048">Krugman, P. (2012, January 20). Taxes at the top. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. A27.</span> As the director of Citizens for Tax Justice explained, “The low taxes on capital gains and dividends are why people who make a ton of money, which is largely from investment income, do awfully well. The Warren Buffetts, the hedge fund managers—they pay really low tax rates” (Confessore, Kocieniewski, &amp; Parker, 2011, p. A1).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_049">Confessore, N., Kocieniewski, D., &amp; Parker, A. (2011, January 18).

A27).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_050">Krugman, P. (2012, January 20). Taxes at the top. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. A27.</span></p>

After adjusting for inflation, their after-tax income grew by a much greater amount than that for the poorest families from 1979 to 2007. Income grew by only 18 percent for the poorest fifth but by 65 percent for the wealthiest fifth (excluding the top 1 percent), and it also grew by a whopping 275 percent for families in the top 1 percent (Congressional Budget Office, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_051">Congressional Budget Office.

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Impact of Economic Inequality</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s02_p01">Why should we care if economic inequality has increased and if the United States has the highest degree of inequality of all industrial democracies? One answer is that it is a matter of fairness. The United States is not only the wealthiest nation in the world; it is also a nation that historically has stressed that everyone is created equal and that everyone has an equal opportunity to pursue the “American dream” by becoming economically successful. Against this backdrop, a high degree of economic inequality is simply “un-American” and unfair.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s02_p02">Beyond this rather philosophical critique are more practical considerations. First, a high degree of economic inequality is strongly associated with a high degree of poverty and near poverty: If the rich are getting richer, there is normally less wealth to “go around,” and the poor get poorer. For the same reason, high economic inequality is also associated with a shrinking of the middle class. In the United States, as both poverty (and near poverty) and wealth have increased, the size of the middle class has reduced, as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers has emphasized (Krueger, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_052">Krueger, A. B. (2012). The rise and consequences of inequality in the United States.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s02_p03">Second, a high degree of economic inequality is also associated with low <em class="emphasis">economic mobility</em> (the movement of people up or down the socioeconomic ladder) (Krueger, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_053">Krueger, A.

It also has lower economic mobility: Americans born into poverty or near poverty are less likely than their counterparts in other democracies to be able to move up the socioeconomic ladder (DeParle, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_054">DeParle, J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s02_p04">Next, high economic inequality may slow economic growth. This possible effect occurs for at least three reasons (Krueger, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_055">Krueger, A. B. (2012). The rise and consequences of inequality in the United States.

Second, a shrinking middle class means there is less spending by the middle class to stimulate the economy. Third, workers’ morale is likely to be lower in a society with higher economic inequality, and their lower morale decreases their productivity. As the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers has stated, “The evidence suggests that a growing middle class is good for the economy, and that a more fair distribution of income would hasten economic growth. Businesses would benefit from restoring more fairness to the economy by having more middle class customers, more stable markets, and improved employee morale and productivity” (Krueger, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_056">Krueger, A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s02_p05">Finally, many social scientists consider nations with high degrees of economic inequality to be “unhealthy societies,” to quote the title of a book on this issue (Wilkinson, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_057">Wilkinson, R.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Tax Evasion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s05_p01">Another significant problem in the American economy is <em class="emphasis">tax evasion</em>. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) periodically estimates the amount of tax evasion and derives a figure it calls the tax gap: the difference between what Americans owe in federal taxes and what they actually pay. Much of the annual tax gap results from the failure of professionals such as physicians and attorneys to report self-employment income and from the claiming of false deductions by wealthy individuals and families (Braithwaite, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_059">Braithwaite, V.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s05_p02">In January 2012, the IRS released its estimate of the tax gap for 2006. The initial tax gap was $450 billion. After payment of late taxes and certain enforcement efforts, this gap was reduced to $385 billion, still an astronomical figure; tax evasion by corporations amounted for about $70 billion of this amount. The total tax gap is about twenty times greater than the annual economic loss from property crimes such as burglary and motor vehicle theft. In 2006, the federal budget deficit was $248 billion. If everyone had paid the taxes they owed, there would have been no deficit at all, and the federal government in fact would have had a surplus of $137 billion (Pizzigati, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_060">Pizzigati, S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s06_s01_p02">Employee theft occurs for many reasons, but a common reason is worker dissatisfaction with various aspects of their job. They may think their wages or salaries are too low, they may feel they have been treated unfairly by their employer, and so forth. As the estimates of the amount of employee theft suggest, this form of theft is not condemned by many people, and, indeed, many workplaces have informal norms that approve of certain forms of theft—for example, it is OK to steal inexpensive objects such as (depending on the workplace) utensils, food, pencils and pens, or toilet paper. Not surprisingly, embezzlement is often more costly to an employer than pilferage; although it can involve just a few dollars from a cash register, it can also involve hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars acquired through more sophisticated means.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s06_s01_p03">When we think of employee theft, we probably usually think of theft by blue-collar or lower white-collar employees. However, physicians, attorneys, and other professionals also steal from their patients/clients or from the government, even if their form of theft is often much more complex and sophisticated than what the term “employee theft” may usually imply. Attorneys may bill their clients for work that was never done, and physicians may bill Medicare or private insurance for patients they never saw or for procedures that were never performed. We call this form of “employee” theft <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">professional fraud</a><span class="glossdef">Stealing by physicians, attorneys, and other professionals from their patients/clients or from the government.</span></span>.

As disturbing as this number was, it represented a sharp drop from the numbers that prevailed a decade earlier, when 1,080 workplace homicides occurred in 1994.

The first and by far the most common type is homicide as the result of robbery. This category includes the many store clerks, gas station attendants, taxi drivers, and other employees who are slain during a robbery, as well as police who are killed as they try to stop a robbery or apprehend the offender. The second category is homicide committed as an act of domestic violence; in this type, the offender, almost always a man, seeks out his wife or girlfriend (or ex-wife or ex-girlfriend) at her workplace and kills her. The third category involves disgruntled workers, such as the North Carolina lumber employee just discussed, who kill one or more people at their workplace whom they blame for problems the killers have been having. Although this type of homicide is the type that the phrase “workplace violence” or “workplace killings” usually brings to mind, it is actually the least common of the three types listed here (Fox, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_067">Fox, J.
