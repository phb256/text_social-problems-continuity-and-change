    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_p01">At first glance, the environment does not seem to be a sociological topic. The natural and physical environment is something that geologists, meteorologists, oceanographers, and other scientists should be studying, not sociologists. Yet we have just discussed how the environment is affected by population growth, and that certainly sounds like a sociological discussion. In fact, the environment is very much a sociological topic for several reasons.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_p02">First, our worst environmental problems are the result of human activity, and this activity, like many human behaviors, is a proper topic for sociological study. This textbook has discussed many behaviors: racist behavior, sexist behavior, criminal behavior, sexual behavior, and others. Just as these behaviors are worthy of sociological study, so are the behaviors that harm (or try to improve) the environment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_p03">Second, environmental problems have a significant impact on people, as do the many other social problems that sociologists study. We see the clearest evidence of this impact when a major hurricane, an earthquake, or another natural disaster strikes. In January 2010, for example, a devastating earthquake struck Haiti and killed more than 250,000 people, or about 2.5 percent of that nation’s population. The effects of these natural disasters on the economy and society of Haiti will certainly also be felt for many years to come.</p>

        <p class="para">As is evident in this photo taken in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake that devastated Haiti, changes in the natural environment can lead to profound changes in a society. Environmental changes are one of the many sources of social change.</p>

        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_p04">Slower changes in the environment can also have a large social impact. As noted earlier, industrialization and population growth have increased the pollution of our air, water, and ground. Climate change, a larger environmental problem, has also been relatively slow in arriving but threatens the whole planet in ways that climate change researchers have documented and will no doubt be examining for the rest of our lifetimes and beyond. We return to these two environmental problems shortly.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_p05">A third reason the environment is a sociological topic is a bit more complex: Solutions to our environmental problems require changes in economic and environmental policies, and the potential implementation and impact of these changes depends heavily on social and political factors. In the United States, for example, the two major political parties, corporate lobbyists, and environmental organizations regularly battle over attempts to strengthen environmental regulations.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_p06">A fourth reason is that many environmental problems reflect and illustrate social inequality based on social class and on race and ethnicity: As with many problems in our society, the poor and people of color often fare worse when it comes to the environment. We return to this theme later in our discussion of environmental racism.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_p07">Fifth, efforts to improve the environment, often called the <em class="emphasis">environmental movement</em>, constitute a social movement and, as such, are again worthy of sociological study. Sociologists and other social scientists have conducted many studies of why people join the environmental movement and of the impact of this movement.</p>
    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Environmental Sociology</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p01">All these reasons suggest that the environment is quite fittingly a sociological topic, and one on which sociologists should have important insights. In fact, so many sociologists study the environment that their collective study makes up a subfield in sociology called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">environmental sociology</a><span class="glossdef">The study of the interaction between human behavior and the natural and physical environment.</span></span>, which refers simply to the sociological study of the environment. More specifically, environmental sociology is the study of the interaction between human behavior and the natural and physical environment. According to a report by the American Sociological Association, environmental sociology “has provided important insights” (Nagel, Dietz, &amp; Broadbent, 2010, p. 13)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_044">Nagel, J., Dietz, T., &amp; Broadbent, J. (Eds.). (2010). <em class="emphasis">Workshop on sociological perspectives on global climate change</em>. Washington, DC: National Science Foundation.</span> into such areas as public opinion about the environment, the influence of values on people’s environmental behavior, and inequality in the impact of environmental problems on communities and individuals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p02">Environmental sociology assumes “that humans are part of the environment and that the environment and society can only be fully understood in relation to each other” (McCarthy &amp; King, 2009, p. 1).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_045">McCarthy, D., &amp; King, L. (2009). Introduction: Environmental problems require social solutions. In L. King &amp; D. McCarthy (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Environmental sociology: From analysis to action</em> (2nd ed., pp. 1–22). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.</span> Because humans are responsible for the world’s environmental problems, humans have both the ability and the responsibility to address these problems. As sociologists Leslie King and Deborah McCarthy (2009, p. ix)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_046">King, L., &amp; McCarthy, D. (Eds.). (2009). <em class="emphasis">Environmental sociology: From analysis to action</em> (2nd ed.). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.</span> assert, “We both strongly believe that humans have come to a turning point in terms of our destruction of ecological resources and endangerment of human health. A daily look at the major newspapers points, without fail, to worsening environmental problems…Humans created these problems and we have the power to resolve them. Naturally, the longer we wait, the more devastating the problems will become; and the more we ignore the sociological dimensions of environmental decline the more our proposed solutions will fail.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p03">Environmental sociologists emphasize two important dimensions of the relationship between society and the environment: (a) the impact of human activity and decision making and (b) the existence and consequences of environmental inequality and environmental racism. We now turn to these two dimensions.</p>
        <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Human Activity and Decision Making</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01_p01">Perhaps more than anything else, environmental sociologists emphasize that <em class="emphasis">environmental problems are the result of human decisions and activities that harm the environment</em>. Masses of individuals acting independently of each other make decisions and engage in activities that harm the environment, as when we leave lights on, keep our homes too warm in the winter or too cool in the summer, and drive motor vehicles that get low gas mileage. Corporations, government agencies, and other organizations also make decisions and engage in practices that greatly harm the environment. Sometimes individuals and organizations know full well that their activities are harming the environment, and sometimes they just act carelessly without much thought about the possible environmental harm of their actions. Still, the environment is harmed whether or not individuals, corporations, and governments intend to harm it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01_p02">A major example of the environmental harm caused by human activity was the British Petroleum (BP) oil spill that began in April 2010 when an oil rig leased by BP exploded in the Gulf of Mexico and eventually released almost 5 million barrels of oil (about 200 million gallons) into the ocean. Congressional investigators later concluded that BP had made a series of decisions that “increased the danger of a catastrophic well,” including a decision to save money by using an inferior casing for the well that made an explosion more likely. A news report paraphrased the investigators as concluding that “some of the decisions appeared to violate industry guidelines and were made despite warnings from BP’s own employees and outside contractors” (Fountain, 2010, p. A1).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_047">Fountain, H. (2010, June 15). Documents show risky decisions before BP blowout. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. A1.</span></p>

McCarthy (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Environmental Sociology: From Analysis to Action</em> (2nd ed., pp. 1–22). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.</span> cite several other environmental accidents that stemmed from reckless decision making and natural disasters in which human decisions accelerated the harm that occurred. One accident occurred in Bhopal, India, in 1984, when a Union Carbide pesticide plant leaked forty tons of deadly gas. Between 3,000 and 16,000 people died immediately and another half million suffered permanent illnesses or injuries. A contributing factor for the leak was Union Carbide’s decision to save money by violating safety standards in the construction and management of the plant.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01_p04">A second preventable accident was the 1989 <em class="emphasis">Exxon Valdez</em> oil tanker disaster, in which the tanker hit ground off the coast of Alaska and released 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. Among other consequences, the spill killed hundreds of thousands of birds and marine animals and almost destroyed the local fishing and seafood industries. The immediate cause of the accident was that the ship’s captain was an alcoholic and left the bridge in the hands of an unlicensed third mate after drinking five double vodkas in the hours before the crash occurred. Exxon officials knew of his alcoholism but let him command the ship anyway. Also, if the ship had had a double hull (one hull inside the other), it might not have cracked on impact or at least would have released less oil, but Exxon and the rest of the oil industry had successfully lobbied Congress not to require stronger hulls.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s01_p05">Hurricane Katrina was a more recent environmental disaster in which human decision making resulted in a great deal of <em class="emphasis">preventable</em> damage. After Katrina hit the Gulf Coast and especially New Orleans in August 2005, the resulting wind and flooding killed more than 1,800 people and left more than 700,000 homeless. McCarthy and King (2009, p. 4)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_049">McCarthy, D., &amp; King, L. (2009). Introduction: Environmental problems require social solutions. In L. King &amp; D. McCarthy (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Environmental sociology: From analysis to action</em> (2nd ed., pp. 1–22). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.</span> attribute much of this damage to human decision making: “While hurricanes are typically considered ‘natural disasters,’ Katrina’s extreme consequences must be considered the result of social and political failures.” Long before Katrina hit, it was well known that a major flood could easily breach New Orleans levees and have a devastating impact. Despite this knowledge, US, state, and local officials did nothing over the years to strengthen or rebuild the levees. In addition, coastal land that would have protected New Orleans had been lost over time to commercial and residential development. In short, the flooding after Katrina was a human disaster, not a natural disaster.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p01">A second emphasis of environmental sociology is <em class="emphasis">environmental inequality</em> and the related concept of <em class="emphasis">environmental racism</em>. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Environmental inequality</a><span class="glossdef">The disproportionate exposure of low-income people and people of color to various environmental problems.</span></span> (also called <em class="emphasis">environmental injustice</em>) refers to the fact that low-income people and people of color are disproportionately likely to experience various environmental problems, while <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">environmental racism</a><span class="glossdef">The disproportionate exposure of people of color to various environmental problems.</span></span> refers just to the greater likelihood of people of color to experience these problems (Walker, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_050">Walker, G.

                <h3 class="title">Applying Social Research</h3>
                <p class="simpara">Environmental Racism in the Land of Cotton</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p02">During the 1970s, people began to voice concern about the environment in the United States and across the planet. As research on the environment grew by leaps and bounds, some scholars and activists began to focus on environmental inequality in general and on environmental racism in particular. During the 1980s and 1990s, their research and activism spawned the environmental justice movement that has since shed important light on environmental inequality and racism and helped reduce these problems.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p03">Research by sociologists played a key role in the beginning of the environmental justice movement and continues to play a key role today. Robert D. Bullard of Clark Atlanta University stands out among these sociologists for the impact of his early work in the 1980s on environmental racism in the South and for his continuing scholarship since then. He has been called “the father of environmental justice” and was named by <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> as one of the thirteen most influential environmental leaders of the twentieth century, along with environmental writer Rachel Carson, former vice president Al Gore, and ten others.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p04">Bullard’s first research project on environmental racism began in the late 1970s after his wife, an attorney, filed a lawsuit on behalf of black residents in Atlanta who were fighting the placement of a landfill in their neighborhood. To collect data for the lawsuit, Bullard studied the placement of landfills in other areas. He found that every city-owned landfill in Houston was in a black neighborhood, even though African Americans amounted to only one-fourth of Houston residents at the time. He also found that three out of four privately owned landfills were in black neighborhoods, as were six of the eight city-owned incinerators. He extended his research to other locations and later recalled what he discovered: “Without a doubt, it was a form of apartheid where whites were making decisions and black people and brown people and people of color, including Native Americans on reservations, had no seat at the table.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p05">In 1990, Bullard published his findings in his book <em class="emphasis">Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality</em>. This book described the systematic placement in several Southern states of toxic waste sites, landfills, and chemical plants in communities largely populated by low-income residents and/or African Americans. <em class="emphasis">Dumping in Dixie</em> was the first book to examine environmental racism and is widely credited with helping advance the environmental justice movement. It received some notable awards, including the Conservation Achievement Award from the National Wildlife Federation.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p06">More recently, Bullard, along with other sociologists and scholars from other disciplines, has documented the impact of race and poverty on the experience of New Orleans residents affected by the flooding after Hurricane Katrina. As in many other cities, African Americans and other low-income people largely resided in the lower elevations in New Orleans, and whites and higher-income people largely resided in the higher elevations. The flooding naturally had a much greater impact on the lower elevations and thus on African Americans and the poor. After the flood, African Americans seeking new housing in various real estate markets were more likely than whites to be told that no housing was available.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p07">Bullard’s early work alerted the nation to environmental racism and helped motivate the Environmental Protection Agency in the 1990s to begin paying attention to it. His various research efforts are an outstanding example of how social research can increase understanding of a significant social problem.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p08">According to the American Sociological Association report mentioned earlier, the emphasis of environmental sociology on environmental inequality reflects the emphasis that the larger discipline of sociology places on social inequality: “A central finding of sociology is that unequal power dynamics shape patterns of social mobility and access to social, political, and economic resources” (Nagel et al., 2010, p. 17).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_052">Nagel, J., Dietz, T., &amp; Broadbent, J. (Eds.). (2010). <em class="emphasis">Workshop on sociological perspectives on global climate change</em>. Washington, DC: National Science Foundation.</span> The report adds that global climate change will have its greatest effects on the poorest nations: “Many of the countries least responsible for the rise in greenhouse gases will be most likely to feel its impacts in changes in weather, sea levels, health care costs, and economic hardships” (Nagel et al., 2010, p. 17).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_053">Nagel, J., Dietz, T., &amp; Broadbent, J. (Eds.). (2010). <em class="emphasis">Workshop on sociological perspectives on global climate change</em>. Washington, DC: National Science Foundation.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p09">Examples of environmental racism and inequality abound. Almost all the hazardous waste sites we discuss later in this chapter are located in or near neighborhoods and communities that are largely populated by low-income people and people of color. When factories dump dangerous chemicals into rivers and lakes, the people living nearby are very likely to be low-income and of color. Around the world, the people most affected by climate change and other environmental problems are those in poor nations and, even within those nations, those who are poorer rather than those who are wealthier.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p10">Some evidence shows that although low-income people are especially likely to be exposed to environmental problems, this exposure is even more likely if they are people of color than if they are white. As a review of this evidence concluded, “It would be fair to summarize this body of work as showing that the poor and especially the nonwhite poor bear a disproportionate burden of exposure to suboptimal, unhealthy environmental conditions in the United States. Moreover, the more researchers scrutinize environmental exposure and health data for racial and income inequalities, the stronger the evidence becomes that grave and widespread environmental injustices have occurred throughout the United States” (Evans &amp; Kantrowitz, 2002, p. 323).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_054">Evans, G. W., &amp; Kantrowitz, E. (2002). Socioeconomic status and health: The potential role of environmental risk exposure. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Public Health, 23</em>(1), 303.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_s02_p11">As should be apparent from the discussion in this section, the existence of environmental inequality and environmental racism shows that social inequality in the larger society exposes some people much more than others to environmental dangers. This insight is one of the most important contributions of environmental sociology.</p>

Most air pollution stems from the burning of fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal. This problem occurs not only in the wealthy industrial nations but also in the nations of the developing world; countries such as China and India have some of the worst air pollution. In developing nations, mortality rates of people in cities with high levels of particulate matter (carbon, nitrates, sulfates, and other particles) are 15–50 percent higher than the mortality rates of those in cleaner cities. In European countries, air pollution is estimated to reduce average life expectancy by 8.6 months.

                <p class="simpara">Children and Environmental Health Hazards</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s01_p04">As we consider environmental problems, we must not forget the world’s children, who are at special risk for environmental health problems precisely because they are children. Their bodies and brains grow rapidly, and they breathe in more air per pound of body weight than adults do. They also absorb substances, including toxic substances from their gastrointestinal tract faster than adults do.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s01_p05">These and other physiological differences all put children at greater risk than adults for harm from environmental health hazards. Children’s behavior also puts them at greater risk. For example, no adult of normal intelligence would eat paint chips found on the floor, but a young child can easily do so. Children also play on lawns, playgrounds, and other areas in which pesticides are often used, and this type of activity again gives them greater exposure. Young children also put their hands in their mouths regularly, and any toxins on their hands are thereby ingested.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s01_p06">Poverty compounds all these problems. Poor children are more likely to live in houses with lead paint, in neighborhoods with higher levels of air pollution, and in neighborhoods near to hazardous waste sites. Poor children of color are especially at risk for these environmental problems.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s01_p07">Three of the greatest environmental health hazards for children are lead, pesticides, and air pollution. Lead can cause brain and nervous system damage, hearing problems, and delayed growth among other effects; pesticides can cause various problems in the immune, neurological, and respiratory systems; and air pollution can cause asthma and respiratory illnesses. All these health problems can have lifelong consequences.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s01_p08">Unfortunately, certain environmentally induced health problems for children are becoming more common. For example, US children’s asthma cases have increased by more than 40 percent since 1980, and more than four hundred American children now have asthma. Two types of childhood cancer thought to stem at least partly from environmental hazards have also increased during the past two decades: acute lymphocytic by 10 percent and brain tumors by 30 percent.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s01_p09">It should be evident from this overview that environmental health hazards pose a serious danger for children in the United States and the rest of the world. Because children are our future, this danger underscores the need to do everything possible to improve the environment.</p>

Drinking water is often unsafe because of poor sanitation procedures for human waste in poor nations and because of industrial discharge into lakes, rivers, and streams in wealthy nations. Inadequate sanitation and unsafe drinking water cause parasitic infections and diseases such as diarrhea, malaria, cholera, intestinal worms, typhoid, and hepatitis A. The World Health Organization estimates that unsafe drinking water and inadequate sanitation cause the following number of annual deaths worldwide: (a) 2.5 million deaths from diarrhea, including 1.4 million child deaths from diarrhea; (b) 500,000 deaths from malaria; and (c) 860,000 child deaths from malnutrition. At least 200 million more people annually suffer at least one of these serious diseases due to inadequate sanitation and unsafe drinking water (Cameron, Hunter, Jagals, &amp; Pond, 2011; Prüss-Üstün, Bos, Gore, &amp; Bartram, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_066">Cameron, J., Hunter, P., Jagals, P., &amp; Pond, K.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s04_p01">Nuclear power has been an environmental controversy at least since the 1970s. Proponents of nuclear power say it is a cleaner energy than fossil fuels such as oil and coal and does not contribute to global warming. Opponents of nuclear power counter that nuclear waste is highly dangerous no matter how it is disposed, and they fear meltdowns that can result if nuclear power plant cores overheat and release large amounts of radioactive gases into the atmosphere.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s04_p02">The most serious nuclear plant disaster involved the Chernobyl plant in Ukraine in 1986. Chernobyl’s core exploded and released radioactive gases into the atmosphere that eventually spread throughout Europe. The amount of radiation released was four hundred times greater than the amount released by the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima at the end of World War II. About five-dozen people (Chernobyl workers or nearby residents) soon died because of the disaster. Because radiation can cause cancer and other health problems that take years to develop, scientists have studied the health effects of the Chernobyl disaster for the last quarter-century. According to the United Nations Scientific Committee of the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), an estimated 27,000 additional cancer deaths worldwide will eventually result from the Chernobyl disaster (Gronlund, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_067">Gronlund, L.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s04_p03">Seven years earlier in March 1979, a nuclear disaster almost occurred in the United States at the Three Mile Island plant in central Pennsylvania. A series of technological and human failures allowed the plant’s core to overheat to almost disastrous levels. The nation held its breath for several days while officials sought to bring the problem under control. During this time, some 140,000 people living within twenty miles of the plant were evacuated. The near disaster severely weakened enthusiasm for nuclear power in the United States, and the number of new nuclear plants dropped sharply in the ensuing two decades (Fischer, 1997).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_068">Fischer, D.

More than 80,000 residents had to be evacuated because of the massive release of radioactive gases and water, and they remained far from their homes a year later as high levels of radiation continued to be found in the evacuated area. A news report on the anniversary of the disaster described the desolation that remained: “What’s most striking about Japan’s nuclear exclusion zone is what you don’t see. There are no people, few cars, no sign of life, aside from the occasional livestock wandering empty roads. Areas once home to 80,000 people are now ghost towns, frozen in time.

According to the UCS, “If [these reactors] were confronted with a similar challenge, it would be foolish to assume the outcome would not also be similar.” It adds that although earthquakes can cause fires at reactors, US plants routinely violate fire protection standards. A news report on the similarities between US nuclear power plants and the Fukushima plant reached a similar conclusion, noting that US nuclear power plants “share some or all of the risk factors that played a role at Fukushima” (Zeller, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_073">Zeller, T., Jr. (2011, March 14).

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s04_p06">As this conclusion implies, nuclear power critics say NRC oversight of the nuclear industry is too lax. A 2011 investigation by the Associated Press (AP) yielded support for this criticism (Donn, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_074">Donn, J. (2011, June 20). As nuclear plants age, NRC loosens safety regulations. <em class="emphasis">The Boston Globe</em>, p. A2.</span> The AP found that the NRC has been “working closely with the nuclear power industry to keep the nation’s aging reactors operating within safety standards by repeatedly weakening those standards or simply failing to enforce them.” The report continued, “Time after time, officials at the [NRC] have decided that original regulations were too strict, arguing that safety margins could be eased without peril.” For example, when certain valves at nuclear plants leaked, the NRC revised its regulations to permit more leakage. Also, when cracking of steam generator tubes allowed radiation to leak, standards on tubing strength were weakened. And when reactors began to violate temperature standards, the NRC almost doubled the permitted temperatures. The investigation found “thousands” of problems in aging reactors that it said the NRC have simply ignored, and it concluded that a “cozy relationship” exists between the NRC and the nuclear industry.</p>

                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s05_p05">One was Lois Gibbs, who led a movement of residents of Love Canal to call attention to the dumping of hazardous waste in their neighborhood, as just discussed in the text. Gibbs had never been politically active before 1978, when evidence of the dumping first came to light. After reading a newspaper article about the dumping, she began a petition to shut down a local school that was next to the dump site. Her efforts generated a good deal of publicity and prompted state officials to perform environmental tests in the homes near the site. Two years later the federal government authorized funding to relocate 660 families from the dangerous area. Gibbs later wrote, “It will take a massive effort to move society from corporate domination, in which industry’s rights to pollute and damage health and the environment supersede the public’s right to live, work, and play in safety. This is a political fight. The science is already there, showing that people’s health is at risk. To win, we will need to keep building the movement, networking with one another, planning, strategizing, and moving forward. Our children’s futures, and those of their unborn children, are at stake.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s05_p06">The second woman was Erin Brockovich, the subject of a 2000 film of that name starring Julia Roberts. Brockovich also was not politically active before she discovered hazardous waste dumping while she was working as a legal assistant for a small California law firm. As part of her work on a real estate case, she uncovered evidence that Pacific Gas &amp; Electric had been dumping a toxic industrial solvent for thirty years into the water supply of the small town of Hinkley. Her investigation led to a lawsuit that ended in 1996 with the awarding of $333 million in damages to several hundred Hinkley residents.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s05_p07">Both Lois Gibbs and Erin Brockovich have remained active on behalf of environmental safety in the years since their celebrated initial efforts. They are two heroic women who have made a very significant difference.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s06_p01">The world’s oceans are at peril for several reasons, with “potentially dire impacts for hundreds of millions of people across the planet,” according to a news report (ScienceDaily, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_076">ScienceDaily. (2010, June 19). Ocean changes may have dire impact on people. <em class="emphasis">ScienceDaily</em>.

This reduction certainly makes it difficult for people to eat certain fishes at restaurants or buy them at supermarkets, but a far more important problem concerns the ocean food chain (Weise, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_077">Weise, E. (2011, July 15). Predator loss can start food-chain reaction. <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, p. 9A.</span> As the supply of various ocean animals has dwindled, the food supply for the larger ocean animals that eat these smaller animals has declined, putting the larger animals at risk. And as the number of these larger animals has declined, other animals that prey on these larger animals have had to turn to other food sources or not have enough to eat. This chain reaction in the ocean food chain has serious consequences for the ocean’s ecosystem.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s06_p02">One example of this chain reaction involves killer whales and sea otters in the ocean off of western Alaska (Weise, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_078">Weise, E. (2011, July 15). Predator loss can start food-chain reaction. <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, p. 9A.</span> Killer whales eat many things, but sea lions and harbor seals form a key part of their diet. However, the supply of these ocean mammals in western Alaska and elsewhere has decreased because of human overfishing of their prey fish species. In response, killer whales have been eating more sea otters, causing a 90 percent decline in the number of sea otters in western Alaska. Because sea otters eat sea urchins, the loss of sea otters in turn has increased the number of sea urchins there. And because sea urchins consume kelp beds, kelp beds there are disappearing, removing a significant source of food for other ocean life (Estes et al., 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_079">Estes, J.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s06_p03">Another example of the ocean chain reaction concerns whales themselves. The whaling industry that began about 1,000 years ago and then intensified during the eighteenth century severely reduced the number of whales and made right whales almost extinct. In southern oceans, whale feces are an important source of nutrients for very small animals and plankton. As the whale population in these oceans has declined over the centuries, these animals and plankton that are essential for the ocean’s ecosystem have suffered immeasurable losses (Weise, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_080">Weise, E.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s06_p05">A familiar bycatch example to many Americans is the accidental catching and killing of dolphins when tuna are being caught by large fishing nets. A less familiar example involves sea turtles. These animals’ numbers have declined so steeply in recent decades that six of the seven species of sea turtles are in danger of extinction. The major reason for this danger is bycatch from shrimp trawl nets and other types of fishing. This bycatch has killed millions of sea turtles since 1990 (Viegas, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_082">Viegas, J. (2010, April 6).

They help protect shorelines from natural disasters such as tsunamis, and they attract tens of billions of dollars in tourism.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s06_p07">Despite all these benefits, coral reefs have long been endangered by overfishing, tourism, and coastal development, among other factors. Scientists have now found that climate change is also harming coral reefs (Rudolf, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_083">Rudolf, J. C. (2011, June 5). Under the sea, coral reefs in peril. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. WK3.</span> The global warming arising from climate change is overheating coral reefs throughout the world. This overheating in turn causes the reefs to expel the algae they consume for food; the algae are also responsible for the reefs’ bright colors. The reefs then turn pale and die, and their deaths add to the ocean’s food chain problem already discussed. Scientists estimate that three-fourths of the earth’s reefs are at risk from global warming, and that one-fifth of all reefs have already been destroyed. They further estimate that almost all reefs will be at risk by 2050.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s06_p08">Global warming will continue to be a main culprit in this regard, but so will increasing acidity, yet another problem arising from climate change. As carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere, much of it falls into the ocean. This lowers the oceans’ pH level and turns the oceans more acidic. This increasing acidity destroys coral reefs and also poses a risk to commercial species such as clams, lobsters, and mussels.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s06_p09">An additional ocean problem stemming from climate change is rising sea levels (Daley, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn15_084">Daley, B.

This problem means that storm surges during severe weather are becoming an ever-greater problem. Even without storm surges, much coastal land has already been lost to rising ocean levels. Despite these problems, many coastal communities have failed to build adequate barriers that would minimize damage from ocean flooding.</p>

But they also result from the fact that livestock are routinely given antibiotics to keep them healthy despite the crowded and often dirty conditions in which they live.
