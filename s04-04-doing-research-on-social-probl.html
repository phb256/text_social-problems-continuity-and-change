        <h2 class="title editable block">Surveys</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p01">The <em class="emphasis">survey</em> is the most common method by which sociologists gather their data. The Gallup poll is perhaps the most well-known example of a survey and, like all surveys, gathers its data with the help of a questionnaire that is given to a group of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">respondents</a><span class="glossdef">People who answer a questionnaire.</span></span>. The Gallup poll is an example of a survey conducted by a private organization, but sociologists do their own surveys, as does the government and many organizations in addition to Gallup. Many surveys are administered to respondents who are randomly chosen and thus constitute a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">random sample</a><span class="glossdef">A subset drawn from the larger population in which every unit in the population has the same chance of being included in the subset.</span></span>. In a random sample, everyone in the population (whether it be the whole US population or just the population of a state or city, all the college students in a state or city or all the students at just one college, etc.) has the same chance of being included in the survey. The beauty of a random sample is that it allows us to generalize the results of the sample to the population from which the sample comes. This means that we can be fairly sure of the behavior and attitudes of the whole US population by knowing the behavior and attitudes of just four hundred people randomly chosen from that population.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p02">Some surveys are <em class="emphasis">face-to-face</em> surveys, in which interviewers meet with respondents to ask them questions. This type of survey can yield much information, because interviewers typically will spend at least an hour asking their questions, and a high <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">response rate</a><span class="glossdef">The percentage of a sample that agrees to be included in a study, usually a survey.</span></span> (the percentage of all people in the sample who agree to be interviewed), which is important to be able to generalize the survey’s results to the entire population. On the downside, this type of survey can be very expensive and time consuming to conduct.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p03">Because of these drawbacks, sociologists and other researchers have turned to telephone surveys. Most Gallup polls are conducted over the telephone. Computers do random-digit dialing, which results in a random sample of all telephone numbers being selected. Although the response rate and the number of questions asked are both lower than in face-to-face surveys (people can just hang up the phone at the outset or let their answering machine take the call), the ease and low expense of telephone surveys are making them increasingly popular. Surveys done over the Internet are also becoming more popular, as they can reach many people at very low expense. A major problem with web surveys is that their results cannot necessarily be generalized to the entire population because not everyone has access to the Internet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s01_p04">Surveys are used in the study of social problems to gather information about the behavior and attitudes of people regarding one or more problems. For example, many surveys ask people about their use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs or about their experiences of being unemployed or in poor health. Many of the chapters in this book will present evidence gathered by surveys carried out by sociologists and other social scientists, various governmental agencies, and private research and public interest firms.</p>

    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Experiments</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Experiments</em> are the primary form of research in the natural and physical sciences, but in the social sciences they are for the most part found only in psychology. Some sociologists still use experiments, however, and they remain a powerful tool of social research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p02">The major advantage of experiments, whether they are done in the natural and physical sciences or in the social sciences, is that the researcher can be fairly sure of a cause-and-effect relationship because of the way the experiment is set up. Although many different experimental designs exist, the typical experiment consists of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">experimental group</a><span class="glossdef">In an experiment, the group that experiences the experimental condition.</span></span> and a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">control group</a><span class="glossdef">In an experiment, the group that does not experience the experimental condition.</span></span>, with subjects <em class="emphasis">randomly assigned</em> to either group. The researcher does something to the experimental group that is not done to the control group. If the two groups differ later in some variable, then it is safe to say that the condition to which the experimental group was subjected was responsible for the difference that resulted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p03">Most experiments take place in the laboratory, which for psychologists may be a room with a one-way mirror, but some experiments occur in the field, or in a natural setting (<em class="emphasis">field experiments</em>). In Minneapolis, Minnesota, in the early 1980s, sociologists were involved in a much-discussed field experiment sponsored by the federal government. The researchers wanted to see whether arresting men for domestic violence made it less likely that they would commit such violence again. To test this hypothesis, the researchers had police do one of the following after arriving at the scene of a domestic dispute: They either arrested the suspect, separated him from his wife or partner for several hours, or warned him to stop but did not arrest or separate him. The researchers then determined the percentage of men in each group who committed repeated domestic violence during the next six months and found that those who were arrested had the lowest rate of recidivism, or repeat offending (Sherman &amp; Berk, 1984).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn01_023">Sherman, L. W., &amp; Berk, R. A. (1984). The specific deterrent effects of arrest for domestic assault. <em class="emphasis">American Sociological Review, 49</em>, 261–272.</span> This finding led many jurisdictions across the United States to adopt a policy of mandatory arrest for domestic violence suspects. However, replications of the Minneapolis experiment in other cities found that arrest sometimes reduced recidivism for domestic violence but also sometimes increased it, depending on which city was being studied and on certain characteristics of the suspects, including whether they were employed at the time of their arrest (Sherman, 1992).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn01_024">Sherman, L. W. (1992). <em class="emphasis">Policing domestic violence: Experiments and dilemmas</em>. New York, NY: Free Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s02_p04">As the Minneapolis study suggests, perhaps the most important problem with experiments is that their results are not <em class="emphasis">generalizable</em> beyond the specific subjects studied. The subjects in most psychology experiments, for example, are college students, who obviously are not typical of average Americans: They are younger, more educated, and more likely to be middle class. Despite this problem, experiments in psychology and other social sciences have given us very valuable insights into the sources of attitudes and behavior. Scholars of social problems are increasingly using field experiments to study the effectiveness of various policies and programs aimed at addressing social problems. We will examine the results of several such experiments in the chapters ahead.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Observational Studies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">Observational</em> research, also called <em class="emphasis">field research</em>, is a staple of sociology. Sociologists have long gone into the field to observe people and social settings, and the result has been many rich descriptions and analyses of behavior in juvenile gangs, bars, urban street corners, and even whole communities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_p02">Observational studies consist of both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">participant observation</a><span class="glossdef">Field research in which the researcher is an active member of the group or setting being observed.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonparticipant observation</a><span class="glossdef">Field research in which the researcher merely observes a group or setting</span></span>. Their names describe how they differ. In participant observation, the researcher is part of the group that she or he is studying, spends time with the group, and might even live with people in the group. Several classical social problems studies of this type exist, many of them involving people in urban neighborhoods (Liebow, 1967; Liebow, 1993; Whyte, 1943).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn01_025">Liebow, E. (1967). <em class="emphasis">Tally’s corner</em>. Boston, MA: Little, Brown; Liebow, E. (1993). <em class="emphasis">Tell them who I am: The lives of homeless women</em>. New York, NY: Free Press; Whyte, W. F. (1943). <em class="emphasis">Street corner society: The social structure of an Italian slum</em>. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.</span> In nonparticipant observation, the researcher observes a group of people but does not otherwise interact with them. If you went to your local shopping mall to observe, say, whether people walking with children looked happier than people without children, you would be engaging in nonparticipant observation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_p03">Similar to experiments, observational studies cannot automatically be generalized to other settings or members of the population. But in many ways they provide a richer account of people’s lives than surveys do, and they remain an important method of research on social problems.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Existing Data</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p01">Sometimes sociologists do not gather their own data but instead analyze <em class="emphasis">existing data</em> that someone else has gathered. The US Census Bureau, for example, gathers data on all kinds of areas relevant to the lives of Americans, and many sociologists analyze census data on such social problems as poverty, unemployment, and illness. Sociologists interested in crime and the criminal justice system may analyze data from court records, while medical sociologists often analyze data from patient records at hospitals. Analysis of existing data such as these is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">secondary data analysis</a><span class="glossdef">The analysis of data from existing records.</span></span>. Its advantage to sociologists is that someone else has already spent the time and money to gather the data. A disadvantage is that the data set being analyzed may not contain data on all the topics in which a sociologist may be interested or may contain data on topics that are not measured in ways the sociologist might prefer.</p>

    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Scientific Method and Objectivity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s05_p01">This section began by stressing the need for sound research in the study of social problems. But what are the elements of sound research? At a minimum, such research should follow the rules of the <em class="emphasis">scientific method</em>. As you probably learned in high school and/or college science classes, these rules—formulating hypotheses, gathering and testing data, drawing conclusions, and so forth—help guarantee that research yields the most accurate and reliable conclusions possible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s05_p02">An overriding principle of the scientific method is that research should be conducted as <em class="emphasis">objectively</em> as possible. Researchers are often passionate about their work, but they must take care not to let the findings they expect and even hope to uncover affect how they do their research. This in turn means that they must not conduct their research in a manner that helps achieve the results they expect to find. Such bias can happen unconsciously, and the scientific method helps reduce the potential for this bias as much as possible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch01_s04_s05_p03">This potential is arguably greater in the social sciences than in the natural and physical sciences. The political views of chemists and physicists typically do not affect how an experiment is performed and how the outcome of the experiment is interpreted. In contrast, researchers in the social sciences, and perhaps particularly in sociology, often have strong feelings about the topics they are studying. Their social and political beliefs may thus influence how they perform their research on these topics and how they interpret the results of this research. Following the scientific method helps reduce this possible influence.</p>
