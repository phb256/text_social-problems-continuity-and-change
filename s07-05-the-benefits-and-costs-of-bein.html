    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s05_p01">Most of the discussion so far has been about women, and with good reason: In a sexist society such as our own, women are the subordinate, unequal sex. But <em class="emphasis">gender</em> means more than <em class="emphasis">female</em>, and a few comments about men are in order.</p>
    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Benefits</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p01">We have already discussed gender differences in occupations and incomes that favor men over women. In a patriarchal society, men have more wealth than women and more influence in the political and economic worlds more generally.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p02">Men profit in other ways as well. In <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch03#barkansoc_1.0-ch03">Chapter 3 "Racial and Ethnic Inequality"</a>, we talked about white privilege, or the advantages that whites automatically have in a racist society whether or not they realize they have these advantages. Many scholars also talk about <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">male privilege</a><span class="glossdef">The advantages a male enjoys in a patriarchal society just because he is a male.</span></span>, or the advantages that males automatically have in a patriarchal society whether or not they realize they have these advantages (McIntosh, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn04_076">McIntosh, P. (2007). White privilege and male privilege: A personal account of coming to see correspondence through work in women’s studies. In M. L. Andersen &amp; P. H. Collins (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">Race, class, and gender: An anthology</em> (6th ed.). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s05_s01_p03">A few examples illustrate male privilege. Men can usually walk anywhere they want or go into any bar they want without having to worry about being raped or sexually harassed. Susan Griffin was able to write “I have never been free of the fear of rape” because she was a woman; it is no exaggeration to say that few men could write the same thing and mean it. Although some men are sexually harassed, most men can work at any job they want without having to worry about sexual harassment. Men can walk down the street without having strangers make crude remarks about their looks, dress, and sexual behavior. Men can ride the subway system in large cities without having strangers grope them, flash them, or rub their bodies against them. Men can apply for most jobs without worrying about being rejected because of their gender, or, if hired, not being promoted because of their gender. We could go on with many other examples, but the fact remains that in a patriarchal society, men automatically have advantages just because they are men, even if race/ethnicity, social class, and sexual orientation affect the degree to which they are able to enjoy these advantages.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p01">Yet it is also true that men pay a price for living in a patriarchy. Without trying to claim that men have it as bad as women, scholars are increasingly pointing to the problems men face in a society that promotes male domination and traditional standards of masculinity such as assertiveness, competitiveness, and toughness (Kimmel &amp; Messner, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn04_077">Kimmel, M. S., &amp; Messner, M. A. (Eds.). (2010). <em class="emphasis">Men’s lives</em> (8th ed.). Boston, MA: Allyn &amp; Bacon.</span> Socialization into masculinity is thought to underlie many of the emotional problems men experience, which stem from a combination of their emotional inexpressiveness and reluctance to admit to, and seek help for, various personal problems (Wong &amp; Rochlen, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn04_078">Wong, Y. J., &amp; Rochlen, A. B. (2005). Demystifying men’s emotional behavior: New directions and implications for counseling and research. <em class="emphasis">Psychology of Men &amp; Masculinity, 6</em>, 62–72.</span> Sometimes these emotional problems build up and explode, as mass shootings by males at schools and elsewhere indicate, or express themselves in other ways. Compared to girls, for example, boys are much more likely to be diagnosed with emotional disorders, learning disabilities, and attention deficit disorder, and they are also more likely to commit suicide and to drop out of high school.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p02">Men experience other problems that put themselves at a disadvantage compared to women. They commit much more violence than women do and, apart from rape and sexual assault, also suffer a much higher rate of violent victimization. They die earlier than women and are injured more often. Because men are less involved than women in child rearing, they also miss out on the joy of parenting that women are much more likely to experience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch04_s05_s02_p03">Growing recognition of the problems males experience because of their socialization into masculinity has led to increased concern over what is happening to American boys. Citing the strong linkage between masculinity and violence, some writers urge parents to raise their sons differently in order to help our society reduce its violent behavior (Corbett, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn04_079">Corbett, K. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Boyhoods: Rethinking masculinities</em>. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.</span> In all these respects, boys and men—and our nation as a whole—are paying a very real price for being male in a patriarchal society.</p>

                <li>In a patriarchal society, males automatically have certain advantages, including a general freedom from fear of being raped and sexually assaulted and from experiencing job discrimination on the basis of their gender.</li>
