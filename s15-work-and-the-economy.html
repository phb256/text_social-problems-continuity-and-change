        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_p01">“White-Collar Workers Join Crowds Straining Food Banks,” the headline said. Amid the nation’s continuing faltering economy, middle-class families across the United States who had lost their jobs were being forced to get free food at food pantries. One woman, who lost her job as a consultant, said her family’s savings had dwindled to less than $200. “Without the network of food pantries around us, I don’t know how we would have eaten,” she said. As more middle-class workers were turning to the food pantries, the pantries’ donations had fallen. As one food pantry official put it, “We’re seeing many faces from the middle class who had been donors who now need support from our food bank. Right now, our donations are softer than we would like them to be.” Meanwhile, a survey of college-educated New York residents found that 30 percent said they had trouble affording food.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_p02">One of the most momentous events of the twentieth century was the Great Depression, which engulfed the United States in 1929 and spread to the rest of the world, lasting almost a decade. Millions were thrown out of work, and bread lines became common. In the United States, a socialist movement gained momentum for a time as many workers blamed US industry and capitalism for their unemployment.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_p03">The Depression involved the failing of the economy. The economy also failed in the United States beginning in late 2007, when the country entered what has been called the Great Recession. Although the recession has officially ended, the jobless rate remains much higher than before the recession. The news article that began this chapter provides just a small illustration of the millions of lives that have been affected.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_p04">This chapter examines the many problems related to work and the economy in the United States today. It also examines the related issues of economic inequality and economic mobility. As we shall see, the United States has a mediocre record in both these areas when compared to other wealthy democracies.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_p01">When we hear the term <em class="emphasis">economy</em>, it is usually in the context of how the economy “is doing”: Is inflation soaring or under control? Is the economy growing or shrinking? Is unemployment rising, declining, or remaining stable? Are new college graduates finding jobs easily or not? All these questions concern the economy, but sociologists define <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">economy</a><span class="glossdef">The social institution that organizes the production, distribution, and consumption of a society’s goods and services.</span></span> more broadly as the social institution that organizes the production, distribution, and consumption of a society’s goods and services. Defined in this way, the economy touches us all. Keep in mind that the economy is not the same as <em class="emphasis">government</em>, which is the social institution through which power is distributed and exercised. Economy and government are social institutions that are certainly intertwined, but conceptually they are distinct.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_p02">The economy is composed of three sectors. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary sector</a><span class="glossdef">The part of the economy that takes and uses raw materials directly from the natural environment.</span></span> is the part of the economy that takes and uses raw materials directly from the natural environment.

The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">secondary sector</a><span class="glossdef">The part of the economy that transforms raw materials into finished products.</span></span> of the economy transforms raw materials into finished products and is essentially the manufacturing industry. Finally, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tertiary sector</a><span class="glossdef">The part of the economy that provides services rather than products.</span></span> is the part of the economy that provides services rather than products; its activities include clerical work, health care, teaching, and information technology services.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_p03">Societies differ in many ways, but they all have to produce, distribute, and consume goods and services. How this happens depends on which sectors of the economy are most important. This latter variable in turn depends heavily on the level of a society’s development. Generally speaking, the less developed a society’s economy, the more important its primary sector; the more developed a society’s economy, the more important its tertiary sector. As societies developed economically over the centuries, the primary sector became less important and the tertiary sector became more important. The primary sector was certainly the only sector in the hunting-and-gathering societies that existed thousands of years ago, while the tertiary sector dominates much of the economy in today’s wealthiest democracies.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Economic Systems</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_p01">The two major economic systems in modern societies are capitalism and socialism. In practice, no one society is purely capitalist or socialist, so it is helpful to think of capitalism and socialism as lying on opposite ends of a continuum. Societies’ economies mix elements of both capitalism and socialism but do so in varying degrees, so that some societies lean toward the capitalist end of the continuum, while other societies lean toward the socialist end. For example, the United States is a capitalist nation, but the government still regulates many industries to varying degrees. The industries usually would prefer less regulation, while their critics usually prefer more regulation. The degree of such regulation was the point of controversy after the failure of banks and other financial institutions in 2008 and 2009. Let’s see how capitalism and socialism differ.</p>
        <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Capitalism</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Capitalism</a><span class="glossdef">An economic system in which the means of production are privately owned.</span></span> is an economic system in which the means of production are privately owned. By <em class="emphasis">means of production</em>, we mean everything—land, tools, technology, and so forth—that is needed to produce goods and services. As outlined by famed Scottish philosopher Adam Smith (1723–1790), widely considered the founder of modern economics, the most important goal of capitalism is the pursuit of personal profit (Smith, 1776/1910).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_002">Smith, A. (1910). <em class="emphasis">The wealth of nations</em>. (Original work published 1776). London, United Kingdom: University Paperbacks.</span> As individuals seek to maximize their own wealth, society as a whole is said to benefit. Goods get produced, services are rendered, people pay for the goods and services they need and desire, and the economy and society as a whole prosper.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p02">As people pursue personal profit under capitalism, they compete with each other for the greatest profits. Businesses try to attract more demand for their products in many ways, including lowering prices, creating better products, and advertising how wonderful their products are. In capitalist theory, such competition helps ensure the best products at the lowest prices, again benefiting society as a whole. Such competition also helps ensure that no single party controls an entire market. According to Smith, the competition that characterizes capitalism should be left to operate on its own, free of government intervention or control. For this reason, capitalism is often referred to as <em class="emphasis">laissez-faire</em> (French for “leave alone”) capitalism, and terms to describe capitalism include the <em class="emphasis">free-enterprise system</em> and the <em class="emphasis">free market</em>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p03">The hallmarks of capitalism, then, are private ownership of the means of production, the pursuit of profit, competition for profit, and the lack of government intervention in this competition.</p>

        <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Socialism</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s02_p01">The features of socialism are the opposite of those just listed for capitalism and were spelled out most famously by Karl Marx. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Socialism</a><span class="glossdef">An economic system in which the means of production are collectively owned, usually by the government.</span></span> is an economic system in which the means of production are collectively owned, usually by the government. Whereas the United States has several airlines that are owned by airline corporations, a socialist society might have one government-owned airline.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s02_p02">The most important goal of socialism is not the pursuit of personal profit but rather work for the collective good: The needs of society are considered more important than the needs of the individual. Because of this view, individuals do not compete with each other for profit; instead they work together for the good of everyone. If under capitalism the government is supposed to let the economy alone, under socialism the government controls the economy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s02_p03">The ideal outcome of socialism, said Marx, would be a truly classless or <em class="emphasis">communist</em> society. In such a society all members are equal, and stratification does not exist. Obviously Marx’s vision of a communist society was never fulfilled, and nations that called themselves communist departed drastically from his vision of communism.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s02_p04">Recall that societies can be ranked on a continuum ranging from mostly capitalist to mostly socialist. At one end of the continuum, we have societies characterized by a relatively free market, and at the other end we have those characterized by strict government regulation of the economy. <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s02_f01">Figure 12.1 "Capitalism and Socialism across the Globe"</a> depicts the nations of the world along this continuum.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Comparing Capitalism and Socialism</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s03_p01">People have debated the relative merits of capitalism and socialism at least since the time of Marx (Bowles, 2012; Cohen, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_003">Bowles, P. (2012). <em class="emphasis">Capitalism</em>. New York, NY: Longman; Cohen, G. A. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Why not socialism?</em> Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.</span> Compared to socialism, capitalism has several advantages. It produces greater economic growth and productivity, at least in part because it provides more incentives (i.e., profit) for economic innovation. It also is often characterized by greater political freedom in the form of civil rights and liberties. As an economic system, capitalism seems to lend itself to personal freedom: Because its hallmarks include the private ownership of the means of production and the individual pursuit of profit, there is much more emphasis in capitalist societies on the needs and desires of the individual and less emphasis on the need for government intervention in economic and social affairs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s03_p02">Yet capitalism also has its drawbacks. There is much more economic inequality in capitalism than in socialism. Although capitalism produces economic growth, not all segments of capitalism share this growth equally, and there is a much greater difference between the rich and poor than under socialism. People can become very rich in capitalist nations, but they can also remain quite poor.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s03_p03">Another possible drawback depends on whether you prefer competition or cooperation. It is often said that important values in the United States include competition and individualism, both of which arguably reflect this nation’s capitalist system. Children in the United States are raised with more of an individual orientation than children in socialist societies, who learn that the needs of their society are more important than the needs of the individual. Whereas US children learn to compete with each other for good grades, success in sports, and other goals, children in socialist societies learn to cooperate to achieve tasks.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s03_p04">More generally, capitalism is said by its critics to encourage selfish and even greedy behavior: If individuals try to maximize their profit, they do so at the expense of others. In competition, someone has to lose. A company’s ultimate aim, and one that is generally lauded, is to maximize its profits by driving another company out of the market altogether. If so, that company succeeds even if some other party is hurting. The small mom-and-pop grocery stores, drugstores, and hardware stores are almost a thing of the past, as big-box stores open their doors and drive their competition out of business. To its critics, then, capitalism encourages harmful behavior, and there are many losers in capitalism. Yet it is precisely this type of behavior that is taught in business schools.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s03_p05">As a business columnist recently summarized these problems of capitalism,</p>
            <span class="blockquote block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s03_bl01">

These nations differ in many ways, but they also share many similarities. In particular, they are all social democracies, as their governments own important industries while their citizens enjoy much political freedom. Each nation has the three branches of government with which most people are familiar—executive, judicial, and legislative—and each nation has a national parliament to which people are elected by proportional representation.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s04_p03">Social democracies like the Scandinavian nations are often called controlled capitalist market economies. The word <em class="emphasis">controlled</em> here conveys the idea that their governments either own industries or heavily regulate industries they do not own. A key feature of these social democracies’ economies is that inequality in wealth and income is not generally tolerated. Employers, employees, and political officials are accustomed to working closely to ensure that poverty and its related problems are addressed as much as possible and in as cooperative a manner as possible.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s04_p04">Underlying this so-called <em class="emphasis">social welfare model</em> is a commitment to <em class="emphasis">universalism</em>. All citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic status or family situation, receive various services, such as child care and universal health care, that are free or heavily subsidized. To support this massive provision of benefits, the Scandinavian nations have very high taxes that their citizens generally accept as normal and necessary.</p>

Most of the currently employed work full-time, but more than 26 million work only part-time. Of this number, 69 percent work part-time for noneconomic reasons; for example, they have childcare or other family obligations, or they are in school.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Functionalism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p01">Recall that the functionalist perspective highlights the many functions that social institutions serve for society. Accordingly, this perspective paints a positive picture of work and the economy by pointing to their many benefits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p02">The economy’s major function is also an absolutely essential function: the provision of goods and services. Because the economy provides the goods and services that any society needs, the economy makes a society possible. As we saw earlier, capitalist and socialist societies provide goods and services in different ways, and each type of economy has its advantages and disadvantages. Regardless of the relative merits of capitalism and socialism, however, both a capitalist economy and socialist economy make possible the societies in which they are found.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p03">Many high school students have summer jobs or after-school jobs. Whether or not they go to college, most people work for pay once they reach adulthood. Some work full-time until they retire, some alternate full-time work and part-time work, and some may start out with a job but drop out of the labor force to raise their children. Regardless of these various work patterns, the most important function that most people derive from working is their paycheck. Simply put, work provides the income that most people need for food, clothing, shelter, and other essential needs in today’s society.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p04">But work has important, nonmaterial functions beyond helping us pay the bills. Many people consider their job part of their overall identity, just as the college students reading this book consider being a student as part of their current identity. As we enter adulthood, we are not just a spouse, partner, parent, or child of our parents; we are also an accountant, banker, claims adjuster, day care worker, elementary school teacher, financial consultant, garage door installer, and so forth. The job we have helps provide us with a sense of who we are, or, to put it another way, a sense of our identity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p05">Especially if we enjoy our jobs, work can also give us a sense of self-fulfillment, self-confidence, and self-esteem. These psychological effects combine to form yet another important function of work.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p06">A third function is friendships. Many people have friends and acquaintances whom they met at their workplaces or at least through their work (McGuire, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_009">McGuire, G. M. (2007). Intimate work: A typology of the social support that workers provide to their network members. <em class="emphasis">Work and Occupations, 34</em>, 125–147.</span> Coworkers discuss all kinds of topics with each other, including personal matters, sports, and political affairs, and they often will invite other coworkers over to their homes or go out with them to a movie or a restaurant. These friendships are yet another benefit that work often provides.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_p07">The nonmaterial benefits that work provides for many people are important and should not be discounted. Although this is speculative, many wealthy people no longer need to work but continue to work because of these nonmaterial benefits. National survey data support the importance of work’s nonmaterial benefits in this regard. In the 2010 General Social Survey (GSS), respondents in the labor force were asked, “If you were to get enough money to live as comfortably as you would like for the rest of your life, would you continue to work or would you stop working?” More than two-thirds (68.7 percent) of these respondents replied that they would indeed continue working.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Conflict Theory</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p01">Conflict theory’s views of work and the economy largely derive from the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels during the nineteenth century. As <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch01#barkansoc_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Understanding Social Problems"</a> discussed, Marx and Engels sharply criticized capitalism as an economic system that inherently oppresses workers. In their view, the <em class="emphasis">bourgeoisie</em>, or ruling class, owns the means of production, while the <em class="emphasis">proletariat</em>, or working class, does not own the means of production. The bourgeoisie uses its wealth, power, and influence to oppress and exploit the proletariat.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p02">Although today’s conflict theorists are not necessarily Marxists, they nonetheless criticize many aspects of capitalism, and the earlier discussion of the disadvantages of capitalism reflects their views. They also criticize how large companies treat their workers. As just one example, they call attention to the fact that many companies maintain dangerous workplaces that result in injury, illness, and/or death for tens of thousands of workers annually. We return to this particular problem later in this chapter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p03">Conflict theorists also point out that the workplace is a setting for sexual harassment, which was discussed in <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch04#barkansoc_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Gender Inequality"</a>. Although work can and does bring the many benefits assumed by functionalist theory, work can also be a source of great distress for the hundreds of thousands of women and men who are sexually harassed every year.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p04">Marx also wrote that work in a capitalist society is inherently alienating. This is so, he said, because workers do not design the products they build, because factory work (which was the dominant mode of production in Marx’s time) involves boring and repetitive tasks, and because workers are treated by their employers as mere commodities to be hired and fired at will. Reflecting Marx’s views, conflict theory today also points to the alienating nature of work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s02_p05">Following up on this concern, social scientists have tried to determine the extent of worker alienation and job satisfaction, as well as the correlates of these two attitudes (Mauno, Kinnunen, &amp; Feldt, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_010">Mauno, S., Kinnunen, U., &amp; Feldt, T. (2012). Work-family culture and job satisfaction: Does gender and parenting status alter the relationship? <em class="emphasis">Community, Work &amp; Family, 15</em>(1), 101–129.</span> They generally find that American workers like their jobs much more than Marx anticipated but also that the extent to which they like their jobs depends on the income their jobs bring, the degree of autonomy they enjoy in their jobs, and other factors. In the 2010 GSS, 88 percent of respondents said they are “very” or “somewhat” satisfied with the work they do, and only 12 percent said they were dissatisfied. This latter figure is probably much lower than Marx would have predicted for a capitalist society like the United States. One possible reason for this low amount of job dissatisfaction, and one that Marx did not foresee, is the number of workplace friendships as described earlier. Such friendships can lead workers to like their jobs more than they otherwise would and help overcome the alienation they might feel without the friendships.</p>

    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Symbolic Interactionism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_p01">Recall that symbolic interactionism focuses on the interaction of individuals and on how they interpret their interaction. In line with this “micro” focus, many scholars have generated rich descriptions of how certain workplaces’ behaviors and understandings are “negotiated” and of how certain kinds of workers view aspects of their work and interpret the meaning of their work. Numerous studies of this type exist of police officers, prostitutes, attorneys, nurses and physicians, teachers, and a variety of other occupations. Most of these studies are based on intensive interviews of people in these occupations. Taken together, they provide a sensitive portrait of why people enter these various jobs and careers, what they like and dislike about their jobs, how they interact with other people in their workplaces, and a host of other issues.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_p02">A classic study of the workplace grounded in the symbolic interactionist tradition was sociologist Joan Emerson’s (1970)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_011">Emerson, J. P. (1970). Behavior in private places: Sustaining definitions of reality in gynecological examinations. In H. P. Dreitzel (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Recent sociology</em> (Vol. 2, pp. 74–97). New York, NY: Collier.</span> study of gynecological exams. At the time Emerson wrote her study, most gynecologists were men. Because they are necessarily viewing and touching their women patients’ genitals, they have to ensure their patients do not think their doctor is behaving in a sexual manner. For this to happen, Emerson wrote, (male) gynecologists take pains to appear as medical professionals rather than as men interested in having sex or aroused by what they were seeing and feeling. In this way, they “define the situation” as a professional encounter rather than as a sexual encounter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_p03">Male gynecologists use several strategies to appear as professionals, according to Emerson. For example, they have a (female) nurse present during the exam to help the patient feel comfortable. They also certainly avoid saying anything that might suggest they are sexually aroused. More generally, gynecologists and nurses always act in a nonchalant, matter-of-fact manner, which sends the patient an implicit message: “In the medical world the pelvic area is like any other part of the body; its private and sexual connotations are left behind when you enter the hospital” (Emerson, 1970, p. 78).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_012">Emerson, J. P. (1970). Behavior in private places: Sustaining definitions of reality in gynecological examinations. In H. P. Dreitzel (Ed.), <em class="emphasis">Recent sociology</em> (Vol. 2, pp. 74–97). New York, NY: Collier.</span> In all these ways, gynecological exams are defined only as medical encounters, and patients are helped to feel as comfortable as possible under rather uncomfortable circumstances.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_p04">In another classic study grounded in the symbolic interactionist tradition, Jonathan Rubinstein (1993)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_013">Rubinstein, J. (1993). <em class="emphasis">City police</em>. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.</span> spent a year riding around and otherwise interacting with police officers in Philadelphia. He later wrote compellingly about police officers’ constant fear for their safety, about how they try to control suspects and other threatening people without drawing their guns, about how they interact with each other and with their superiors, and many other matters. In one passage, he wrote about how officers (he interviewed police<em class="emphasis">men</em>) try to win and keep the respect of other officers: “A patrolman must learn to avoid any appearance or incompetency if he hopes to maintain the respect of his colleagues. Every man must go to considerable lengths to cover up any weakness or error that might reflect poorly on his competence” (Rubinstein, 1993, p. 105).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_014">Rubinstein, J. (1993). <em class="emphasis">City police</em>. New York, NY: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.</span> Thus officers learn to record dispatchers’ information promptly and accurately, and they avoid remarks that question the competence of other officers.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_p01">The economy and the quality and quantity of work certainly affect the lives of all Americans. At the same time, work and the economy give rise to many kinds of problems that also affect millions of Americans. This section examines several of these problems.</p>
    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Loss of Jobs and Wages</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p01">Because the American economy greatly weakened as the nation went into a deep recession in late 2007, it should come as no surprise that millions of jobs have been lost during the past half-decade and that wages have declined for many Americans. Yet long before the recession began, certain ominous trends in the American economy were evident. These trends involved a general loss of jobs in many sectors of the American economy and stagnating wages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p02">These trends partly reflected the fact that the United States has joined other industrial nations in moving into a <em class="emphasis">postindustrial</em> economy. In a postindustrial economy, information technology and service jobs replace the machines and manufacturing jobs that are hallmarks of an industrial economy. If physical prowess and skill with one’s hands were prerequisites for many industrial jobs, mental prowess and communication skills are prerequisites for postindustrial jobs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p03">This move to a postindustrial economy has been a mixed blessing for many Americans. The information age has obvious benefits too numerous to mention, but there has also been a cost to the many workers whom postindustrialization and the globalization of the economy have left behind. Since the 1980s, many manufacturing companies moved their plants from US cities to sites in the developing world in Asia and elsewhere, a problem called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">capital flight</a><span class="glossdef">The moving of manufacturing companies from US cities to sites in the developing world in Asia and elsewhere.</span></span>. Along with the faltering economy, these trends have helped fuel a loss of 5.5 million manufacturing jobs from the American economy since 2000 (Hall, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_015">Hall, D. (2011, November 3). As the manufacturing sector goes, so goes America? Retrieved January 16, 2012, from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.epi.org/blog/manufacturing-sector-american-economy">http://www.epi.org/blog/manufacturing-sector-american-economy</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p04">A related problem is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">outsourcing</a><span class="glossdef">The hiring by US companies of overseas workers for customer care, billing services, and other jobs that Americans used to do.</span></span>, in which US companies hire workers overseas for customer care, billing services, and other jobs that Americans used to do. China, India, and the Philippines, which have skilled workforces relatively fluent in English, are the primary nations to which US companies outsource their work. According to projections, some 3.4 million jobs will have been lost by 2015 because of outsourcing (Levine, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_016">Levine, L. (2012). <em class="emphasis">Offshoring (or offshore outsourcing) and job loss among US workers</em> (CRS Report RL32292). Retrieved January 17, 2012, from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://forbes.house.gov/UploadedFiles/CRS_-_Offshoring_and_Job_Loss_Among_U_S__Workers.pdf">http://forbes.house.gov/UploadedFiles/CRS_-_Offshoring_and_Job_Loss_Among_U_S__Workers.pdf</a>.</span> Many call centers employ workers in India, and when you call up a computer company or some other business for technical help, you might very well talk with an Indian. Because these call centers have cost Americans jobs and also because Americans and Indians often have trouble understanding each other’s accents, outsourcing has been very controversial since it became popular in the early 2000s.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p05">All these problems reflect a more general shift in the United States from goods-producing jobs to service jobs. Although some of these service jobs, such as many in the financial and computer industries, are high paying, many are in low-wage occupations, such as restaurant and clerical work, that pay less than the goods-producing jobs they replaced. Partly as a result, the average hourly wage (in 2009 dollars) in the United States for workers (excluding managers and supervisors) rose by only one dollar from $17.46 in 1979 to $18.63 in 2009. This change represented an increase of just 0.2 percent per year during that three-decade span, as workers’ wages have essentially stagnated during the last three decades (Economic Policy Institute, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_017">Economic Policy Institute.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p06">Wage changes in recent years also depend on what social class someone is in. While the average compensation of chief executive officers (CEOs) of large corporations grew by 167 percent from 1989 to 2007, the average compensation of the typical worker grew by only 10 percent (Mishel, Bernstein, &amp; Shierholz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_018">Mishel, L., Bernstein, J., &amp; Shierholz, H.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p01">One of the most important developments accompanying industrialization in the nineteenth century was the rise of labor unions and their conflict with management over wages and working conditions (Dubofsky &amp; Dulles, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_020">Dubofsky, M., &amp; Dulles, F. R. (2010). <em class="emphasis">Labor in America: A history</em> (8th ed.). Wheeling, IL: Harlan Davidson.</span> The pay that workers received was quite low, and the conditions in which they worked were often miserable. The typical employee worked at least ten hours a day for six or seven days a week, with almost no overtime pay and no paid vacations or holidays. To improve wages and working conditions, many labor unions were founded after the Civil War, only to meet determined opposition from companies, the government, and the courts. Companies told each other which workers were suspected of being union members, and these workers were then prevented from getting jobs. Strikers were often arrested for violating laws prohibiting strikes. When juries began finding them not guilty, employers turned to asking judges for injunctions that prohibited strikes. Workers who then went on strike were held in contempt of court by the judge as juries were kept out of the process.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p02">Labor strife also marked the Great Depression, when masses of people blamed business leaders for their economic plight. Huge sit-ins and other labor protests occurred at auto plants in Detroit. In response, the Congress passed several laws that gave workers a minimum wage, the right to join unions, a maximum-hour workweek, and other rights that Americans now take for granted.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p03">Today labor unions have lost some of their influence, especially as postindustrialization has supplanted the industrial economy and as the United States has lost much of its manufacturing base. Four decades ago, about one-fourth of all private-sector nonagricultural workers belonged to labor unions. By 1985 this figure had dropped to 14.6 percent, and today it stands at only 7.2 percent (Hirsch &amp; Macpherson, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_021">Hirsch, B., &amp; Macpherson, D. (2011). Union membership and coverage database from the CPS. Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://unionstats.com">http://unionstats.com</a>.</span> In response, labor unions have intensified their efforts to increase their membership, only to find that US labor laws are filled with loopholes that allow companies to prevent their workers from forming a union. For example, after a company’s workers vote to join a union, companies can appeal the vote, and it can take several years for courts to order the company to recognize the union. In the meantime, the low wages, substandard working conditions, and other factors that motivated workers to want to join a union are allowed to continue.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p04">Just as the growth of unions during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries helped to raise workers’ wages, the decline of unions has lowered wages. Two reasons explain this decline (Mishel et al., 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_022">Mishel, L., Bernstein, J., &amp; Shierholz, H. (2009). <em class="emphasis">The state of working America 2008/2009</em>. Ithaca, NY: ILR Press.</span> First, union workers earn about 14 percent more than nonunion workers (controlling for experience, education, occupation, and other factors), a phenomenon known as the <em class="emphasis">union wage premium</em>. Because fewer workers are now in unions than four decades ago, they are less likely to benefit from this premium. Second, as unions have declined, there has been less pressure on nonunion employers to raise their wages to match union wages.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_p05">Because the union wage premium is greater for African Americans and Latinos than for whites, the wage decline caused by the decline of unions has probably been steeper for those two groups than for whites. It is also true that union workers are more likely than nonunion workers to be covered by employer-paid health insurance and also to have lower health premiums and deductibles. The decline of unions has thus meant that the average worker today is less likely to have employer-paid health insurance and, if they do, more likely to have higher premiums and deductibles.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p01">Unemployment is a fact of life. There will always be people laid off or fired, who voluntarily quit their jobs, or who just graduated school and are still looking for work. But most unemployed people are involuntarily unemployed, and for them the financial and psychological consequences can be devastating, as we saw in the news story that began this chapter.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p02">Unemployment rates rise and fall with the economy, and the national unemployment rate was as high as 10.2 percent in October 2009 amid the Great Recession that began almost two years earlier. It was still 8.3 percent in February 2012, amounting to almost 13 million people. But whether unemployment is high or low, it always varies by race and ethnicity, with African American and Latino unemployment rates much higher than the white rate (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_f01">Figure 12.3 "Race, Ethnicity, and Unemployment Rate, February 2012"</a>). Unemployment is also higher for younger people than for older people. In February 2012, 23.8 percent of all teenagers in the labor force (aged 16–19) were unemployed, a figure three times higher than that for adults. The unemployment rate for African Americans in this age group was a very high 34.7 percent, twice as high as the 21.3 percent figure for whites in this age group (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_023">Bureau of Labor Statistics.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p03">Unemployment figures are misleading in an important respect, as they do not include people who are <em class="emphasis">underemployed</em>. Underemployment includes the unemployed and also two other types of people: (a) those who are working part-time but who want to work full-time—the so-called <em class="emphasis">marginally attached</em>, and (b) those who have stopped looking for work because they have not been able to find a job. Many economists think that underemployment provides a more accurate measure than unemployment of the number of people with employment problems.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p04">For example, in December 2011, when the unemployment rate was 8.5 percent and 13 million people were officially unemployed, the underemployment rate was 15.2 percent, equal to 23.8 million people (Shierholz, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_024">Shierholz, H.

Reflecting the racial/ethnic disparity in unemployment, 24.4 percent of African American workers and 22.3 percent of Latino workers were underemployed, compared to only 12.5 percent of white workers. Reflecting on the great amount of underemployment during the Great Recession, one economist commented, “When you combine the long-term unemployed with those who are dropping out and those who are working part time because they can’t find anything else, it is just far beyond anything we’ve seen in the job market since the 1930s” (Herbert, 2010, p.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p05">We have just seen that unemployment rises when the economy falters and that race and ethnicity affect the probability of being unemployed. These two facts provide evidence supporting the <em class="emphasis">sociological imagination</em> (see <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch01#barkansoc_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Understanding Social Problems"</a>). As C. Wright Mills (1959)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_026">Mills, C. W. (1959). <em class="emphasis">The sociological imagination</em>. London, United Kingdom: Oxford University Press.</span> emphasized in his original discussion of this concept, unemployment is best viewed more as a public issue than as a personal trouble. When so many people are unemployed during an economic recession and when there is such striking evidence of higher unemployment rates among the persons of color who have the least opportunity for the education and training needed to obtain and keep a job, it is evident that high unemployment rates reflect a public issue rather than just a collection of public troubles.</p>

                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s01_p08">One problem is racial discrimination on the part of employers, regardless of how conscious employers are of their discriminatory behavior. <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch04#barkansoc_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "Gender Inequality"</a> recounted a study by sociologist Devah Pager (2003),<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_027">Pager, D.

Almost one-third (31 percent) of white testers received a call back or job offer, compared to only 25.2 percent of Latino testers and 15.2 percent of African American testers.

In July 2010, the Pew Research Center issued a report based on a survey of 810 adults who were currently unemployed or had been unemployed since the Great Recession began in December 2007 and 1,093 people who had never been unemployed during the recession (Morin &amp; Kochhar, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_031">Morin, R., &amp; Kochhar, R.

In another finding, 38 percent said they had “lost some self-respect” from being unemployed. One-third said they were finding it difficult to pay their rent or mortgage, compared to only 16 percent of those who had never been unemployed during the recession. Half had borrowed money from family or friends to pay bills, versus only 18 percent of the never unemployed. Of all the people who had been unemployed, almost half had experienced sleep difficulties, and 5 percent had experienced drug or alcohol problems.

                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p04">As unemployment soared in the wake of the Great Recession that began in 2007, many more children lived in a household where a parent had become unemployed. By early 2010, 11 percent of American children, or 8.1 million children overall, had an unemployed parent. Just slightly more than two years earlier, this number had been much smaller, 4.8 million. In just over two years, then, the number of children with an unemployed parent grew by two-thirds.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p05">After their parents became unemployed, these children began to suffer various psychological effects. One news report summarized this psychological impact as follows: “For many families across the country, the greatest damage inflicted by this recession has not necessarily been financial, but emotional and psychological. Children, especially, have become hidden casualties, often absorbing more than their parents are fully aware of. Several academic studies have linked parental job loss—especially that of fathers—to adverse impacts in areas like school performance and self-esteem.”</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p06">The emotional and psychological effects for children occur for at least two reasons. First, unemployed parents tend to experience extra stress and to become withdrawn. Second, married parents and unmarried partners often experience interpersonal conflict when one of them becomes unemployed. Both of these consequences of unemployment in turn affect children in a household where at least one parent is unemployed.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p07">Children have suffered in other ways from the rise in unemployment. More children have become homeless as their households fell into poverty. In addition, children of an unemployed parent are more likely to repeat a grade or, if they are adolescents, to drop out of school. Child abuse has probably also increased in families where a parent became unemployed.</p>
                <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s02_s02_p08">In view of all these consequences for the children of the unemployed, the United States should do everything possible to put parents and other adults back to work and to help the children of unemployed parents deal with the devastating effects of the Great Recession.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p02">Adam Smith, the founder of capitalism, envisioned that individuals would own the means of production and compete for profit, and this is the model the United States followed in its early stage of industrialization. After the Civil War, however, corporations quickly replaced individuals and their families as the owners of the means of production and as the competitors for profit. As corporations grew following the Civil War, they quickly tried to control their markets by, for example, buying up competitors and driving others out of business. To do so, they engaged in bribery, kickbacks, and complex financial schemes of dubious ethics. They also established factories and other workplaces with squalid conditions. Their shady financial practices won their chief executives the name “robber barons” and led the federal government to pass the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 designed to prohibit restraint of trade that raised prices (Hillstrom &amp; Hillstrom, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_033">Hillstrom, K., &amp; Hillstrom, L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s03_p03">More than a century later, corporations have increased in both number and size. Although several million US corporations exist, most are fairly small. Each of the largest five hundred, however, has an annual revenue exceeding $4.3 billion (2011 data) and employs thousands of workers. Their total assets run into the trillions of dollars (Fortune, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_034">Fortune. (2011). Fortune 500.

In many ways, the size and influence of corporations stifle the competition that is one of the hallmarks of capitalism. For example, several markets, including that for breakfast cereals, are controlled by four or fewer corporations. This control reduces competition because it reduces the number of products and competitors, and it thus raises prices to the public (Parenti, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_035">Parenti, M.

Critics of this practice say multinationals not only mistreat workers in poor nations but also exploit these nations’ natural resources. In contrast, defenders of the practice say multinationals are bringing jobs to poor nations and helping them achieve economic growth. As this debate illustrates, the dominance of multinational corporations will certainly continue to spark controversy.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Economic Inequality</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p01">In 2011, the Occupy Wall Street movement gave national attention to economic inequality by emphasizing the differences between the “1%” and the “99%.” Proclaiming “We are the 99%,” they decried the concentration of wealth in the richest of the rich and the growing inequality of the last few decades. (See <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_n01">Note 12.24 "People Making a Difference"</a>.) The issue of economic inequality merits further attention here.</p>

            <h3 class="title">People Making a Difference</h3>
            <p class="simpara">Occupy Wall Street</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p02">Before 2011, economic inequality in the United States certainly existed and in fact had increased greatly since the 1970s. However, although economic inequality was a topic of concern to social scientists, it was not a topic of concern to the general news media. Because the news media generally ignored economic inequality, it was also not a topic of concern to the general public.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p03">That all changed beginning on September 17, 2011, when hundreds of people calling themselves “Occupy Wall Street” marched through the financial district in New York City before dozens encamped overnight and for weeks to come. Occupy Wall Street took these actions to protest the role of major banks and corporations in the economic collapse of 2007 and 2008 and to call attention to their dominance over the political process. Within weeks, similar Occupy encampments had spread to more than one hundred cities in the United States and hundreds more across the globe. “We are the 99%,” they said again and again, as “occupy” became a verb heard repeatedly throughout the United States.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p04">By winter, almost all Occupy encampments had ended either because of legal crackdowns or because of the weather conditions. By that time, however, the Occupy protesters had won news media attention everywhere. In a December 2011 poll by the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of Americans supported the Occupy Wall Street movement, while 35 percent opposed it. Almost half (48 percent) said they agreed with the concerns raised by the movement, compared to 30 percent who said they disagreed with these concerns. In the same poll, 61 percent said the US economic system “unfairly favors the wealthy,” while 36 percent said it was fair to all Americans. In a related area, 77 percent said “there is too much power in the hands of a few rich people and corporations.” In all these items, there was a notable difference by political party preference. For example, 91 percent of Democrats agreed that a few rich people and corporations have too much power, compared to 80 percent of Independents and only 53 percent of Republicans.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p05">Regardless of these political differences, Occupy Wall Street succeeded in bringing economic inequality and related issues into the national limelight. In just a few short months in 2011, it made a momentous difference.</p>

Because most societies are stratified, there will always be some people who are richer or poorer than others, but the key question is <em class="emphasis">how much</em> richer or poorer they are. When the gap between them is large, we say that much economic inequality exists; when the gap between them is small, we say that relatively little economic inequality exists.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_p07">Considered in this light, the United States has a very large degree of economic inequality. A common way to examine inequality is to rank the nation’s families by income from lowest to highest and then to divide this distribution into <em class="emphasis">fifths</em>. Thus we have the poorest fifth of the nation’s families (or the 20 percent of families with the lowest family incomes), a second fifth with somewhat higher incomes, and so on until we reach the richest fifth of families, or the 20 percent with the highest incomes. We then can see what percentage each fifth has of the nation’s <em class="emphasis">entire</em> income. <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_f01">Figure 12.4 "Share of National Income Going to Income Fifths, 2010"</a> shows such a calculation for the United States. The poorest fifth enjoys only 3.3 percent of the nation’s income, while the richest fifth enjoys 50.2 percent. Another way of saying this is that the richest 20 percent of the population have as much income as the remaining 80 percent of the population.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s01_p01">Economic inequality in the United States has increased during the last three decades. The loss of manufacturing jobs and unions accounts for some of this increase. However, a primary reason for the rising inequality has been tax policy. More specifically, the federal government has implemented steep cuts in the highest tax rates for income from salaries and wages and especially in tax rates for income from dividends and capital gains (Hacker &amp; Pierson, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_044">Hacker, J. S., &amp; Pierson, P. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Winner-take-all politics: How Washington made the rich richer—and turned its back on the middle class</em>. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster.</span> This latter cut is especially important because dividends and capital gains account for a much larger share of the income of wealthy families than the income of ordinary families. To be more specific, dividends and capital gains account for only 0.7 percent of the income of the bottom four-fifths of the nation’s families, but for 18.8 percent of the income of the top fifth, 38.2 percent of the top 1 percent, and a striking 51.9 percent of the top 0.1 percent (Hungerford, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_045">Hungerford, T. L. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Changes in the distribution of income among tax filers between 1996 and 2006: The role of labor income, capital income, and tax policy</em>. Washington, DC: Congressional Research Service.</span> In a related statistic, three-fourths of all capital gains are received by the top 1 percent (Krugman, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_046">Krugman, P.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s01_p02">Keep this context in mind as we note that tax cuts in 2003 lowered the tax rate for dividends and capital gains from 28 percent to 15 percent. Meanwhile, the top tax rate for income from salaries and wages is 35 percent. Thus many very wealthy families and individuals pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than many middle- and upper-middle-class families do because so much of the wealthy families’ income is from dividends and capital gains. In fact, the four hundred wealthiest families and individuals in the country pay only about 18 percent of their income in federal tax (Krugman, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_048">Krugman, P. (2012, January 20). Taxes at the top. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. A27.</span> As the director of Citizens for Tax Justice explained, “The low taxes on capital gains and dividends are why people who make a ton of money, which is largely from investment income, do awfully well. The Warren Buffetts, the hedge fund managers—they pay really low tax rates” (Confessore, Kocieniewski, &amp; Parker, 2011, p. A1).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_049">Confessore, N., Kocieniewski, D., &amp; Parker, A. (2011, January 18). Romney shares some tax data; critics pounce. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. A1.</span> This fact prompts a critical question from Paul Krugman, winner of the Nobel Prize in economics: “Is there a good reason why the rich should bear a startlingly light tax burden?” His answer: “Such low taxes on the very rich are indefensible” (Krugman, 2012, p. A27).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_050">Krugman, P. (2012, January 20). Taxes at the top. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. A27.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s01_p03">The lowering of tax rates has helped make the nation’s wealthiest families even wealthier. After adjusting for inflation, their after-tax income grew by a much greater amount than that for the poorest families from 1979 to 2007. Income grew by only 18 percent for the poorest fifth but by 65 percent for the wealthiest fifth (excluding the top 1 percent), and it also grew by a whopping 275 percent for families in the top 1 percent (Congressional Budget Office, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_051">Congressional Budget Office.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s02_p01">Why should we care if economic inequality has increased and if the United States has the highest degree of inequality of all industrial democracies? One answer is that it is a matter of fairness. The United States is not only the wealthiest nation in the world; it is also a nation that historically has stressed that everyone is created equal and that everyone has an equal opportunity to pursue the “American dream” by becoming economically successful. Against this backdrop, a high degree of economic inequality is simply “un-American” and unfair.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s04_s02_p02">Beyond this rather philosophical critique are more practical considerations. First, a high degree of economic inequality is strongly associated with a high degree of poverty and near poverty: If the rich are getting richer, there is normally less wealth to “go around,” and the poor get poorer. For the same reason, high economic inequality is also associated with a shrinking of the middle class. In the United States, as both poverty (and near poverty) and wealth have increased, the size of the middle class has reduced, as the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers has emphasized (Krueger, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_052">Krueger, A.

Second, a shrinking middle class means there is less spending by the middle class to stimulate the economy. Third, workers’ morale is likely to be lower in a society with higher economic inequality, and their lower morale decreases their productivity. As the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers has stated, “The evidence suggests that a growing middle class is good for the economy, and that a more fair distribution of income would hasten economic growth. Businesses would benefit from restoring more fairness to the economy by having more middle class customers, more stable markets, and improved employee morale and productivity” (Krueger, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_056">Krueger, A.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Tax Evasion</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s05_p01">Another significant problem in the American economy is <em class="emphasis">tax evasion</em>. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) periodically estimates the amount of tax evasion and derives a figure it calls the tax gap: the difference between what Americans owe in federal taxes and what they actually pay. Much of the annual tax gap results from the failure of professionals such as physicians and attorneys to report self-employment income and from the claiming of false deductions by wealthy individuals and families (Braithwaite, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_059">Braithwaite, V.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s05_p02">In January 2012, the IRS released its estimate of the tax gap for 2006. The initial tax gap was $450 billion. After payment of late taxes and certain enforcement efforts, this gap was reduced to $385 billion, still an astronomical figure; tax evasion by corporations amounted for about $70 billion of this amount. The total tax gap is about twenty times greater than the annual economic loss from property crimes such as burglary and motor vehicle theft. In 2006, the federal budget deficit was $248 billion. If everyone had paid the taxes they owed, there would have been no deficit at all, and the federal government in fact would have had a surplus of $137 billion (Pizzigati, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_060">Pizzigati, S.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s06_s01_p02">Employee theft occurs for many reasons, but a common reason is worker dissatisfaction with various aspects of their job. They may think their wages or salaries are too low, they may feel they have been treated unfairly by their employer, and so forth. As the estimates of the amount of employee theft suggest, this form of theft is not condemned by many people, and, indeed, many workplaces have informal norms that approve of certain forms of theft—for example, it is OK to steal inexpensive objects such as (depending on the workplace) utensils, food, pencils and pens, or toilet paper. Not surprisingly, embezzlement is often more costly to an employer than pilferage; although it can involve just a few dollars from a cash register, it can also involve hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars acquired through more sophisticated means.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s06_s01_p03">When we think of employee theft, we probably usually think of theft by blue-collar or lower white-collar employees. However, physicians, attorneys, and other professionals also steal from their patients/clients or from the government, even if their form of theft is often much more complex and sophisticated than what the term “employee theft” may usually imply. Attorneys may bill their clients for work that was never done, and physicians may bill Medicare or private insurance for patients they never saw or for procedures that were never performed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s06_s02_p01">In January 2012, a lumber company employee in North Carolina entered the company’s warehouse armed with a twelve-gauge shotgun. He shot and killed three coworkers and critically wounded another coworker. He then returned home, shot himself in the head, and later died at a hospital. A news report described the gunman as a “disgruntled” employee (Muskal, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_065">Muskal, M. (2012).

In 2008, 517 people were slain at their workplaces, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. As disturbing as this number was, it represented a sharp drop from the numbers that prevailed a decade earlier, when 1,080 workplace homicides occurred in 1994. From 2003 through 2008, an average of 497 workplace homicides occurred every year (Needleman, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_066">Needleman, S. E. (2010, August 10).

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s03_s06_s02_p03">In terms of who is involved and the reasons for their involvement, three kinds of workplace homicides are the most common. The first and by far the most common type is homicide as the result of robbery. This category includes the many store clerks, gas station attendants, taxi drivers, and other employees who are slain during a robbery, as well as police who are killed as they try to stop a robbery or apprehend the offender. The second category is homicide committed as an act of domestic violence; in this type, the offender, almost always a man, seeks out his wife or girlfriend (or ex-wife or ex-girlfriend) at her workplace and kills her. The third category involves disgruntled workers, such as the North Carolina lumber employee just discussed, who kill one or more people at their workplace whom they blame for problems the killers have been having. Although this type of homicide is the type that the phrase “workplace violence” or “workplace killings” usually brings to mind, it is actually the least common of the three types listed here (Fox, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_067">Fox, J.

            <li>Understand several types of social reform for improving work and the economy.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s04_p01">This chapter has discussed problems related to work and the economy. Critics of capitalism say many of these and other problems arise from the nature of capitalism. According to this way of thinking, capitalism as an economic system emphasizes competition and thus a “winner takes all” mentality. In this kind of system, there are many losers, and there is also unbridled greed for ever greater wealth. Further, because there is relatively little government regulation in the free-market system that is a hallmark of capitalism, large corporations are left relatively free to engage in behavior that advances their profits but that also stifles competition, harms the environment, and causes other social ills. Regardless of the merits of this general critique, capitalism is not about to disappear. Any improvement in work and the economy, then, must stem from social reforms based on sound social research. This chapter’s discussion points to several important problems that must be addressed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s04_p02">One problem is racial and ethnic discrimination in hiring and employment. Several kinds of studies, but especially field experiments involving job applicants who are similar except for their race and ethnicity, provide powerful evidence of continuing discrimination despite federal and state laws banning it. This evidence certainly suggests the need for stronger enforcement of existing laws against racial and ethnic bias in employment and for public education campaigns to alert workers to signs of this type of discrimination.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s04_p03">A second problem concerns worker morale. Economic inequality and a faltering economy continue to threaten to undermine worker morale and hence worker productivity. Individual employers can do little about these two fundamental problems in the larger economy, but they can do something about worker morale. In this regard, this chapter discussed the importance of coworker friendships for workers’ satisfaction with their jobs and for their more general individual well-being. In view of this importance, employers and employees alike should make special efforts to promote coworker friendships. Because work is such an important part of most people’s lives, these efforts should prove beneficial for many reasons. Employers should also take other measures to improve worker morale, including improvements in wages and working conditions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s04_p04">A third problem is unemployment. Sociologists, psychologists, and other scholars have documented the social and emotional consequences of unemployment. The effects of unemployment go far beyond the loss of money. Revealed by much research, these consequences sometimes seem forgotten in national debates over whether to extend unemployment insurance benefits. But unemployment does have a human face, and it is essential to provide monetary benefits and other kinds of help for the unemployed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s04_p05">A fourth problem is corporate misbehavior. As this chapter discussed, corporations are essential to the US economy but also cause great harm. It is not an exaggeration to say that corporate crime is rampant and that it goes largely unpunished. Stricter federal and state oversight of and sanctions against corporate misbehavior are needed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s04_p06">A fifth problem is economic inequality. The degree of inequality has grown during the past few decades, thanks in large part to changes in the tax codes that greatly favored the wealthy. Restoring tax rates to their standards before the 1980s would help to lessen economic inequality and thus help lessen the problems arising from this type of inequality. In a related area, although the official federal tax rate for corporate profits is 35 percent, many corporations pay a much lower percentage than this because of various loopholes and shelters in the federal tax code. From 2009 to 2011, 280 corporations paid an average of only 18.5 percent of their profits in federal taxes, and 30 of these corporations paid no federal tax during this period (Kocieniewski, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_068">Kocieniewski, D. (2011, November 3). Biggest public firms paid little US tax, study says. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. B1.</span> The corporations’ effective tax rate was lower than that of corporations in many other democracies. For the ten-year period beginning 2002, General Electric paid only 2.3 percent of its profits in federal taxes (Eichler, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_069">Eichler, A.

As the advocacy group Citizens for Tax Justice observes, “Closing the loopholes will have real benefits, including a fairer tax system, reduced federal budget deficits and more resources to improve our roads, bridges and schools—things that are really important for economic development here in the United States” (Kocieniewski, 2011, p. B1).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_070">Kocieniewski, D. (2011, November 3). Biggest public firms paid little US tax, study says. <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, p. B1.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s04_p07">More generally, it is worth noting a recommendation of many observers concerning the federal government’s role in the economy. These observers say the government must take a more active role in improving the national infrastructure, job training, and research and development, and in more generally providing incentives for large corporations to invest their resources in job creation. In this regard, they cite the recent experience of Germany, which has recovered faster than the United States from the worldwide recession (Jacobs, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_071">Jacobs, E. (2012). <em class="emphasis">Growth through innovation: Lessons for the United States from the German labor market miracle</em>. Washington, DC: Brookings Institution.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s04_p08">Germany had this success, these observers say, because it undertook several labor market policies. In particular, Germany provided more generous unemployment benefits than found in the United States (including unemployment compensation in return for working shorter hours, which avoided layoffs), and it provided businesses incentives for employment training and subsidies and incentives to hire the unemployed. Other nations have also eased the effects of the recession because their governments have played this type of active role, one that is much more active than found in the United States. The experience of Germany and of several other nations strongly suggests that “government policy and investment can play a vital role in providing incentives for the private sector,” as one journalist put it (Zakaria, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_072">Zakaria, F.

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s04_p09">In this regard, a comprehensive approach involving job-creation funding is essential (Fieldhouse and Thiess, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_073">Fieldhouse, A., &amp; Thiess, R. (2011). <em class="emphasis">The Restore the American Dream for the 99% Act: An analysis of job-creation provisions</em>. Washington, DC: Economic Policy Institute.</span> This approach would involve federal funding and/or budgetary policy reform in the following areas: (1) funding for the renovation of schools, improvement in transportation, and improvements in other components of the national infrastructure; (2) funding for the hiring of thousands of teachers, child care workers, and community service workers; and (3) expansion of unemployment insurance benefits, both to help the families of the unemployed and to give them money that they will spend to help stimulate the economy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s04_p10">Taken together, these measures promise to create millions of jobs. Because these jobs would stimulate the economy and increase tax revenue, these measures would help to pay for themselves. Additional funding for these measures would come from raising tax rates on the very wealthy, as discussed earlier, and from other types of tax reform, including ending tax loopholes for the oil and gas industry and implementing a “financial speculation tax” (Fieldhouse &amp; Thiess, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn12_074">Fieldhouse, A., &amp; Thiess, R. (2011). <em class="emphasis">The Restore the American Dream for the 99% Act: An analysis of job-creation provisions</em>.

        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch12_s05_l01">
            <li>Capitalism and socialism are the two primary types of economic systems in the world today. Capitalism involves private ownership, the pursuit of profit, and competition for profit, while socialism involves the collective ownership of goods and resources and efforts for the common good. Several nations practice democratic socialism, which is meant to combine the best of capitalism and socialism.</li>
            <li>According to functionalism, the economy makes society possible by providing essential goods and services, while work gives people income and self-fulfillment. According to conflict theory, work is alienating, and the economic elite uses its control of the economy to maintain their elite position. Symbolic interactionism focuses on social interaction in the workplace and on how they perceive the work they do.</li>
            <li>Problems in work and the economy include the following: (a) the loss of jobs and wages; (b) the decline of labor unions; (c) unemployment; (d) corporate misbehavior; (e) rising economic inequality; (f) tax evasion; and (g) workplace crime.</li>
            <li>Social reforms based on sound social science research are needed to improve work and the economy. Two important reforms would involve stricter enforcement of laws against racial discrimination in hiring and employment and of penalties for corporate crime.</li>
