            <li>Explain the value of a sociological perspective for addressing urban housing and crowding problems.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s05_p01">Many urban problems are not, strictly speaking, sociological or other social science problems. For example, traffic congestion is arguably more of an engineering issue than a sociological issue, even if traffic congestion has many social consequences. Other urban problems are problems discussed in previous chapters that disproportionately affect urban areas. For example, crime is more common in urban areas than elsewhere, and racial and ethnic inequality is much more of an issue in urban areas than rural areas because of the concentration of people of color in our cities. Previous chapters have discussed such problems in some detail, and the strategies suggested in those chapters need not be discussed again here.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s05_p02">Still other urban issues exist that this chapter was the first to present. Two of these involve crowding and housing. Cities are certainly crowded, and some parts of cities are especially crowded. Housing is expensive, and many urban residents live in dilapidated, substandard housing. Here again a sociological perspective offers some insight, as it reminds us that these problems are intimately related to inequalities of social class, race and ethnicity, and gender. Although it is critical to provide adequate, affordable housing to city residents, it is also important to remember that these various social inequalities affect who is in most need of such housing. Ultimately, strategies aimed at providing affordable housing will not succeed unless they recognize the importance of these social inequalities and unless other efforts reduce or eliminate these inequalities. Racial residential segregation also remains a serious problem in our nationâ€™s urban centers, and sociologists have repeatedly shown that residential segregation contributes to many of the problems that urban African Americans experience. Reducing such segregation must be a fundamental goal of any strategy to help American cities.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s05_p03">Although traffic congestion is largely an engineering issue, engineers do not operate in a social vacuum. People will be more likely to drive in a city when it is easier for them to drive, and less likely to drive when it is more difficult for them to drive. As the <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s03#barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s03_s05_n01" xrefstyle="select: label">Note 14.19 "Lessons from Other Societies"</a> box illustrated, European cities have done much more than US cities to reduce traffic congestion and thus improve air quality in their cities. Americans may resist the measures the European nations have taken, but the success of these measures suggests that the United States should also use them to deal with the many problems associated with traffic congestion.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s05_p04">Certain problems discussed in previous chapters are also more urgent in rural areas. In particular, the isolation and long distances of rural areas poses special challenges for the provision of adequate health care and for addressing the needs of victims of domestic violence. Ironically, some of the very features that make rural areas so attractive to many people also make them difficult settings for other people. In view of this context, it is essential that public transportation in rural areas be expanded, and that the many types of medical care and social and legal services commonly found in urban areas also be expanded. Although rural residents undoubtedly do not expect to find the range of care and services available to their urban counterparts, they should not have to suffer from a lack of adequate care and services.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s05_l02">
            <li>Many of the problems of urban and rural life were addressed in earlier chapters. The strategies discussed in these chapters to address these problems thus also apply to the problems examined in this chapter.</li>
            <li>Many urban problems are associated with poverty and racial discrimination. Reducing these problems should help relieve urban problems.</li>
            <li>The characteristics of rural areas that often make them so appealing also lead to certain problems that are especially urgent in rural areas.</li>
