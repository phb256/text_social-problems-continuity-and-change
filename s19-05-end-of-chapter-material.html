        <h3 class="title">Summary</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s05_l01">
            <li>President Eisenhower warned of the dangers of a high military budget and the militarism of the United States.</li>
            <li>War actually serves several functions according to functional theory, but conflict theory emphasizes the many problems war causes and the role played in militarism by the military-industrial complex. Symbolic interactionism focuses on the experiences of soldiers and civilians in the military and in wartime and on their perceptions of war and the military.</li>
            <li>War is best regarded as a social phenomenon rather than a biological phenomenon. Decisions to go to war are sometimes based on noble reasons, but they also involve deceit and prejudice.</li>
            <li>Civilians and veterans are both victims of war. Civilian deaths in war are almost inevitable, and atrocities are far from rare. American veterans are at greater risk for PTSD, unemployment, and several other problems that also affect their families.</li>
            <li>The United States has the highest military budget by far in the world. Debate continues over the size of this budget; critics say that the United States would have a higher quality of life if the military budget were reduced and the saved dollars spent on unmet social needs.</li>
            <li>Terrorism is best regarded as rational behavior committed for political reasons rather than as psychologically abnormal behavior. The US response to the 9/11 attacks has cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and critics say that the war on terrorism has both exaggerated the threat of terrorism and diverted attention and funds from unmet social needs.</li>

        <h3 class="title">Using What You Know</h3>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s05_p01">You are a key aide to a US senator who has been asked to participate in a university forum on the size of the US military budget. The senator asks you to write a memo for her that summarizes the arguments on both sides of debate on the military budget and that also indicates your own view of what position the senator should take on this debate. What position will you recommend to the senator? Explain your answer in detail.</p>

        <h3 class="title">What You Can Do</h3>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s05_p02">To help deal with the problems of war and terrorism discussed in this chapter, you may wish to do any of the following:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch16_s05_l02">
            <li>Educate yourself about the military budget and publish a pamphlet on the web and/or in print that critically examines the size of this budget.</li>
            <li>Form or join a peace group on your campus or in the surrounding community that calls attention to the various problems related to the military that were discussed in this chapter.</li>
            <li>Because prejudice against Muslims increased after 9/11, form or join a group in your campus or surrounding community that seeks to improve relations between Muslims and non-Muslims.</li>
