        <h2 class="title editable block">Biological Inferiority</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s01_p01">One long-standing explanation is that blacks and other people of color are <em class="emphasis">biologically inferior</em>: They are naturally less intelligent and have other innate flaws that keep them from getting a good education and otherwise doing what needs to be done to achieve the American Dream. As discussed earlier, this racist view is no longer common today. However, whites historically used this belief to justify slavery, lynchings, the harsh treatment of Native Americans in the 1800s, and lesser forms of discrimination. In 1994, Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray revived this view in their controversial book, <em class="emphasis">The Bell Curve</em> (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994),<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_067">Herrnstein, R. J., &amp; Murray, C. (1994). <em class="emphasis">The bell curve: Intelligence and class structure in American life</em>. New York, NY: Free Press.</span> in which they argued that the low IQ scores of African Americans, and of poor people more generally, reflect their genetic inferiority in the area of intelligence. African Americans’ low innate intelligence, they said, accounts for their poverty and other problems. Although the news media gave much attention to their book, few scholars agreed with its views, and many condemned the book’s argument as a racist way of “blaming the victim” (Gould, 1994).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_068">Gould, S. J. (1994, November 28). Curveball. <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</em>, pp. 139–149.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Cultural Deficiencies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s02_p01">Another explanation of racial and ethnic inequality focuses on supposed <em class="emphasis">cultural deficiencies</em> of African Americans and other people of color (Murray, 1984).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_069">Murray, C. (1984). <em class="emphasis">Losing ground: American social policy, 1950–1980</em>. New York, NY: Basic Books.</span> These deficiencies include a failure to value hard work and, for African Americans, a lack of strong family ties, and are said to account for the poverty and other problems facing these minorities. This view echoes the culture-of-poverty argument presented in <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch02#barkansoc_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Poverty"</a> and is certainly popular today. As we saw earlier, more than half of non-Latino whites think that blacks’ poverty is due to their lack of motivation and willpower. Ironically some scholars find support for this cultural deficiency view in the experience of many Asian Americans, whose success is often attributed to their culture’s emphasis on hard work, educational attainment, and strong family ties (Min, 2005).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_070">Min, P. G. (Ed.). (2005). <em class="emphasis">Asian Americans: Contemporary trends and issues</em> (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.</span> If that is true, these scholars say, then the lack of success of other people of color stems from the failure of their own cultures to value these attributes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s02_p02">How accurate is the cultural deficiency argument? Whether people of color have “deficient” cultures remains hotly debated (Bonilla-Silva, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_071">Bonilla-Silva, E. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Racism without racists: Color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in the United States</em> (3rd ed.). Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield.</span> Many social scientists find little or no evidence of cultural problems in minority communities and say the belief in cultural deficiencies is an example of symbolic racism that blames the victim. Citing survey evidence, they say that poor people of color value work and education for themselves and their children at least as much as wealthier white people do (Holland, 2011; Muhammad, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_072">Holland, J. (2011, July 29). Debunking the big lie right-wingers use to justify black poverty and unemployment. <em class="emphasis">AlterNet</em>.

G. (2007, December 9). White may be might, but it’s not always right. <em class="emphasis">The Washington Post</em>, p. B3.</span> Yet other social scientists, including those sympathetic to the structural problems facing people of color, believe that certain cultural problems do exist, but they are careful to say that these cultural problems arise out of the structural problems. For example, Elijah Anderson (1999)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_073">Anderson, E. (1999). <em class="emphasis">Code of the street: Decency, violence, and the moral life of the inner city</em>. New York, NY: W. W. Norton.</span> wrote that a “street culture” or “oppositional culture” exists among African Americans in urban areas that contributes to high levels of violent behavior, but he emphasized that this type of culture stems from the segregation, extreme poverty, and other difficulties these citizens face in their daily lives and helps them deal with these difficulties. Thus even if cultural problems do exist, they should not obscure the fact that structural problems are responsible for the cultural ones.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Structural Problems</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p01">A third explanation for US racial and ethnic inequality is based in conflict theory and reflects the blaming-the-system approach outlined in <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch01#barkansoc_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Understanding Social Problems"</a>. This view attributes racial and ethnic inequality to <em class="emphasis">structural problems</em>, including institutional and individual discrimination, a lack of opportunity in education and other spheres of life, and the absence of jobs that pay an adequate wage (Feagin, 2006).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_074">Feagin, J. R. (2006). <em class="emphasis">Systematic racism: A theory of oppression</em>. New York, NY: Routledge.</span> Segregated housing, for example, prevents African Americans from escaping the inner city and from moving to areas with greater employment opportunities. Employment discrimination keeps the salaries of people of color much lower than they would be otherwise. The schools that many children of color attend every day are typically overcrowded and underfunded. As these problems continue from one generation to the next, it becomes very difficult for people already at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder to climb up it because of their race and ethnicity (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_n01">Note 3.33 "Applying Social Research"</a>).</p>

            <h3 class="title">Applying Social Research</h3>
            <p class="simpara">The Poor Neighborhoods of Middle-Class African Americans</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p02">In a society that values equal opportunity for all, scholars have discovered a troubling trend: African American children from middle-class families are much more likely than white children from middle-class families to move down the socioeconomic ladder by the time they become adults. In fact, almost half of all African American children born during the 1950s and 1960s to middle-class parents ended up with lower incomes than their parents by adulthood. Because these children had parents who had evidently succeeded despite all the obstacles facing them in a society filled with racial inequality, we have to assume they were raised with the values, skills, and aspirations necessary to stay in the middle class and even to rise beyond it. What, then, explains why some end up doing worse than their parents?</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p03">According to a recent study written by sociologist Patrick Sharkey for the Pew Charitable Trusts, one important answer lies in the neighborhoods in which these children are raised. Because of continuing racial segregation, many middle-class African American families find themselves having to live in poor urban neighborhoods. About half of African American children born between 1955 and 1970 to middle-class parents grew up in poor neighborhoods, but hardly any middle-class white children grew up in such neighborhoods. In Sharkey’s statistical analysis, neighborhood poverty was a much more important factor than variables such as parents’ education and marital status in explaining the huge racial difference in the eventual socioeconomic status of middle-class children. An additional finding of the study underscored the importance of neighborhood poverty for adult socioeconomic status: African American children raised in poor neighborhoods in which the poverty rate declined significantly ended up with higher incomes as adults than those raised in neighborhoods where the poverty rate did not change.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p04">Why do poor neighborhoods have this effect? It is difficult to pinpoint the exact causes, but several probable reasons come to mind. In these neighborhoods, middle-class African American children often receive inadequate schooling at run-down schools, and they come under the influence of youths who care much less about schooling and who get into various kinds of trouble. The various problems associated with living in poor neighborhoods also likely cause a good deal of stress, which, as discussed elsewhere in this chapter, can cause health problems and impair learning ability.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p05">Even if the exact reasons remain unclear, this study showed that poor neighborhoods make a huge difference. As a Pew official summarized the study, “We’ve known that neighborhood matters…but this does it in a new and powerful way. Neighborhoods become a significant drag not just on the poor, but on those who would otherwise be stable.” Sociologist Sharkey added, “What surprises me is how dramatic the racial differences are in terms of the environments in which children are raised. There’s this perception that after the civil rights period, families have been more able to seek out any neighborhood they choose, and that…the racial gap in neighborhoods would whittle away over time, and that hasn’t happened.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p06">Data from the 2010 Census confirm that the racial gap in neighborhoods persists. A study by sociologist John R. Logan for the Russell Sage Foundation found that African American and Latino families with incomes above $75,000 are more likely to live in poor neighborhoods than non-Latino white families with incomes below $40,000. More generally, Logan concluded, “The average affluent black or Hispanic household lives in a poorer neighborhood than the average lower-income white household.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p07">One implication of this neighborhood research is clear: to help reduce African American poverty, it is important to do everything possible to improve the quality and economy of the poor neighborhoods in which many African American children, middle-class or poor, grow up.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p99">Sources: Logan, 2011; MacGillis, 2009; Sharkey, 2009<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_075">Logan, J. R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p08">As we assess the importance of structure versus culture in explaining why people of color have higher poverty rates, it is interesting to consider the economic experience of African Americans and Latinos since the 1990s. During that decade, the US economy thrived. Along with this thriving economy, unemployment rates for African Americans and Latinos declined and their poverty rates also declined. Since the early 2000s and especially since 2008, the US economy has faltered. Along with this faltering economy, unemployment and poverty rates for African Americans and Latinos increased.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch03_s06_s03_p09">To explain these trends, does it make sense to assume that African Americans and Latinos somehow had fewer cultural deficiencies during the 1990s and more cultural deficiencies since the early 2000s? Or does it make sense to assume that their economic success or lack of it depended on the opportunities afforded them by the US economy? Economic writer Joshua Holland (2011)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn03_076">Holland, J. (2011, July 29). Debunking the big lie right-wingers use to justify black poverty and unemployment. <em class="emphasis">AlterNet</em>.

It was exogenous economic factors and changes in public policies, not manifestations of ‘black culture’ [or ‘Latino culture’], that resulted in those widely varied outcomes…While economic swings this significant can be explained by economic changes and different public policies, it’s simply impossible to fit them into a cultural narrative.”</p>
