    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_p01">About one-fourth of the US population and more than 40 percent of the world population live in rural areas. As the previous section demonstrated, a dual view of cities exists: they have many advantages, but they also have many disadvantages. This dual view also applies to rural areas, but it does so in a sort of mirror image: The advantages of cities are often disadvantages for rural areas, and the disadvantages of cities are often advantages for rural areas.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_p02">On the positive side, and focusing on the United States, rural areas feature much more open space and less crowding. Their violent and property crime rates are much lower than those in large cities, as we have seen. The air is cleaner because there is less traffic and fewer factories and other facilities that emit pollution. Life in rural areas is thought to be slower paced, resulting in lower levels of anxiety and a greater sense of relaxation. For these and other reasons, rural residents exhibit better mental health on the average than do urban residents.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_p03">On the negative side, rural areas are often poor and lack the services, employment opportunities, and leisure activities that cities have. Teens often complain of boredom, and drug and alcohol use can be high (Johnson et al., 2008).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_060">Johnson, A. O., Mink, M. D., Harun, N., Moore, C. G., Martin, A. B., &amp; Bennett, K. J. (2008). Violence and drug use in rural teens: National prevalence estimates from the 2003 youth risk behavior survey. <em class="emphasis">Journal of School Health, 78</em>(10), 554–561.</span> Public transportation is often lacking, making it difficult for people without motor vehicles, who tend to have low incomes, to get to workplaces, stores, and other venues (Brown, 2008).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_061">Brown, D. M. (2008). <em class="emphasis">Public transportation on the move in rural America</em>. Washington, DC: Economic Research Service.</span> Rural residents with motor vehicles often must still travel long distances to shop, to visit a doctor, to go to work, and to do any number of other activities. Many rural areas in the United States lack high-speed broadband, a necessity in today’s economy. As a result, their economic development is impaired (Whitacre, 2010).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_062">Whitacre, B. E. (2010). The diffusion of Internet technologies to rural communities: A portrait of broadband supply and demand. <em class="emphasis">American Behavioral Scientist, 53</em>, 1283–1303.</span> All these challenges contribute to special problems in rural areas. We now examine some of these problems.</p>
    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rural Health</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p01">As <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch13#barkansoc_1.0-ch13">Chapter 13 "Health and Health Care"</a> noted, rural areas often lack sufficient numbers of health care professionals, hospitals, and medical clinics. The National Rural Health Association (2012)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_063">National Rural Health Association. (2012). What’s different about rural health care? Retrieved from <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ruralhealthweb.org/go/left/about-rural-health">http://www.ruralhealthweb.org/go/left/about-rural-health</a>.</span> points out that although one-fourth of the US population is rural, only one-tenth of physicians practice in rural areas. Urban areas have 134 physician specialists for every 100,000 residents, but rural areas have less than one-third this number.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p02">Compounding these shortages are other problems. The first is that the small hospitals typical of rural areas generally lack high-quality care and equipment. A patient who needs heart bypass surgery, brain surgery, or other types of complex medical care is likely to have travel to an urban hospital far away.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p03">The second problem is the long distances that ambulances and patients must travel. Because ambulances and other emergency vehicles must travel so far, rural residents with emergencies receive medical attention more slowly than their urban counterparts. The long distances that people must travel make it more difficult for patients with health problems to receive medical care. For example, a rural cancer patient who needs chemotherapy or radiation might have to travel two to three hours in each direction to receive treatment. Travel distances in rural areas also mean that rural residents are less likely than urban residents to receive preventive services such as physical examinations; screenings for breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer; and vaccinations for various illnesses and diseases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p04">In yet another problem, rural areas are also much more likely than urban areas to lack mental health care, drug abuse counseling and programs, and other services related to physical and mental health.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p05">For all these reasons, rural residents are more at risk than urban residents for certain health problems, including mortality. For example, only one-third of all motor vehicle accidents happen in rural areas, but two-thirds of all deaths from such accidents occur in rural areas. These problems help explain why rural residents are more likely than urban residents to report being in only fair or poor health in government surveys (Bennett, Olatosi, &amp; Probst, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_064">Bennett, K. J., Olatosi, B., &amp; Probst, J. C. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Health disparities: A rural-urban chartbook</em>. Columbia, SC: South Carolina Rural Health Research Center.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s01_p06">An additional health problem in rural areas arises from the age profile of their populations. Compared to urban areas, rural areas have an “aging population,” or a greater percentage of adults aged 65 and older. This fact adds to the health-care problems that rural areas must address.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rural Schools and Education</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_p01">The discussion of education in <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch11#barkansoc_1.0-ch11">Chapter 11 "Schools and Education"</a> focused mostly on urban schools. Many of the problems discussed there also apply to rural schools. However, rural schools often face hurdles that urban and suburban schools are much less likely to encounter (Center for Rural Policy and Development, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_065">Center for Rural Policy and Development. (2009). <em class="emphasis">A region apart: A look at challenges and strategies for rural K–12 schools</em>. Saint Peter, MN: Center for Rural Policy and Development.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_p02">First, because rural areas have been losing population, they have been experiencing declining school enrollment and school closings. When a school does close, teachers and other school employees have lost their jobs, and students have to rather suddenly attend a new school that is usually farther from their home than their former school.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_p03">Second, rural populations are generally older than urban populations, as mentioned earlier, and have a greater percentage of retired adults. Therefore, rural areas’ per-capita income and sales tax revenue are lower than that for urban and suburban areas, and this lower revenue makes the funding of public schools more challenging.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_p04">Third, rural families live relatively far from the public schools, and the schools are relatively far from each other. As a result, rural school districts have considerable expenses for transporting children to and from school, after-school athletic events, and other activities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s02_p05">Finally, it is often difficult to recruit and retain quality teachers in rural areas. This problem has forced some rural school districts to offer hiring bonuses or housing assistance to staff their schools.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Rural Poverty</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s03_p01">Although many US cities have high poverty rates, the poverty rate is actually somewhat higher overall in rural areas than in urban areas. In 2010, 16.5 percent of rural residents were classified as officially poor, compared to 14.9 percent of urban residents. However, the poverty rate in the nation’s largest cities was higher yet at 19.7 percent. The number of poor rural residents was almost 8 million, while the number of poor urban residents (reflecting the fact that most Americans live in urban areas) was almost 36 million (DeNavas-Walt, Proctor, &amp; Smith, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_066">DeNavas-Walt, C., Proctor, B. D., &amp; Smith, J. C. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Income, poverty, and health insurance coverage in the United States: 2010</em> (Current Population Reports, P60–239). Washington, DC: US Census Bureau.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s03_p02">Rural poverty is thought to be more persistent than urban poverty because of the factors that contribute to its high rate. These factors include the out-migration of young, highly skilled workers; the lack of industrial jobs that typically have been higher paying than agricultural jobs; and limited opportunities for the high-paying jobs of the information age. Biotech companies, electronics companies, and other symbols of the information age are hardly ever found in the nation’s rural areas. Instead, they locate themselves in or near urban areas, in which are found the universities, masses of people, and other necessary aspects these companies need to succeed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s03_p03">Compounding the general problem of poverty, rural areas are also more likely than nonrural areas to lack human services programs to help the poor, disabled, elderly, and other people in need of aid (National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_067">National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services. (2011). <em class="emphasis">The 2011 report to the secretary: Rural health and human services issues</em>. Washington, DC: US Department of Health and Human Services.</span> Because rural towns are so small, they often cannot afford services such as soup kitchens, homeless shelters, and Meals on Wheels, and thus must rely on services located in other towns. Yet rural towns are often far from each other, making it difficult and expensive for rural residents to obtain the services they need. For example, a Meals on Wheels program in an urban area may travel just a few miles and serve dozens of people, while it may have to travel more than one hundred miles in a rural area and serve only a few people. Adding to this problem is the strong sense in many rural areas that individuals should be strong enough to fend for themselves and not accept government help. Even when services are available, some people who need them decline to take advantage of them because of pride and shame.</p>

    <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Domestic Violence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s04_p01">One of the sad facts of rural life is domestic violence. This form of violence is certainly common in urban areas, but the defining feature of rural areas—a relatively low number of people living in a relatively broad area—creates several problems for victims of domestic violence, most of them women (DeKeseredy &amp; Schwartz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_068">DeKeseredy, W. S., &amp; Schwartz, M. D. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Dangerous exits: Escaping abusive relationships in rural America</em>. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s04_p02">For example, these women often find it difficult to get help and/or to leave their abusers wherever they live. However, it is often even more difficult for rural women to do so. Rural police may be unenlightened about domestic violence and may even know the abuser; for either reason, they may not consider his violence a crime, and abused women may be that much more reluctant to tell the police about their abuse.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch14_s04_s04_p03">Another problem concerns the availability of battered women’s shelters, which provide invaluable services for abused women and any children they might have. These shelters tend to be found in cities, which still do not have nearly enough shelters. Rural areas generally lack shelters, and any shelters that exist are often long distances from the homes of abused women. In rural areas, abused women are also more likely than their urban counterparts to lack neighbors and friends to whom they can turn for support, or at least to live farther from these individuals. For all these reasons, rural women who experience domestic violence face a problem that has been called “dangerous exits” (DeKeseredy &amp; Schwartz, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn14_069">DeKeseredy, W. S., &amp; Schwartz, M. D. (2009). <em class="emphasis">Dangerous exits: Escaping abusive relationships in rural America</em>. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press.</span></p>
