    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p01">As perhaps our most important social institution, the family seems to arouse strong passions from almost everyone. Sociological theory and research, along with research from the other social sciences, have important implications for how our society should address the various family issues discussed in this chapter.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p02">One set of implications concerns the many children and families living in poverty. The households in which they live are mostly headed by women, and the majority of these households are the result of divorce. The programs and policies outlined in <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch02#barkansoc_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Poverty"</a> are certainly relevant for any efforts to help these families. These efforts include, but are not limited to, increased government financial support, subsidies for child care, vocational training and financial aid for schooling for women who wish to return to the labor force or to increase their wages, early childhood visitation and intervention programs, and increases in programs providing nutrition and medical care to poor women and their children (Cherlin, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn10_077">Cherlin, A. J. (2009). The origins of the ambivalent acceptance of divorce. <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marriage &amp; Family, 71</em>(2), 226–229.</span> In all these efforts, the United States has much to learn from the nations of Western Europe (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_n02">Note 10.21 "Lessons from Other Societies"</a>).</p>

        <h3 class="title">Lessons from Other Societies</h3>
        <p class="simpara">Putting Families First: Helping Families in Western Europe</p>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p03">The nations of Western Europe make a much greater effort than the United States to help families with young children. According to sociologist James W. Russell, these nations believe that taking care of their children is a communal responsibility because “society as a whole benefits from having children adequately reared. Children grow up to take over the responsibilities of maintaining the survival of the society. They will also be available to provide needed services to both their own parents and aging adults who did not raise their own children. An aging adult who did not have children may need the services of a younger doctor who was raised by someone else.” In contrast, says Russell, the United States tends to believe that families need to be self-reliant and should not expect very much help from the government. This difference in philosophy leads Western European nations to provide much more support than the United States for families with young children.</p>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p04">This support takes several forms whose nature and extent vary among the Western European nations. Most of the nations, for example, provide at least four months of <em class="emphasis">paid</em> maternity leave after the birth of a child; in contrast, the United States guarantees only three months of <em class="emphasis">unpaid</em> leave, and only for employees who work for companies that employ at least fifty people. Many European nations also provide paid parental leave after the maternity leave benefits expire; the Untied States does not provide this benefit. In Sweden, parents share 450 days of paid leave to care for a new child.</p>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p05">In another striking difference from the United States, all European nations have a family allowance program, which provides cash payments to parents for every child they have after their first child. The intent here is to not only help these families, but also to encourage them to have children to help counter declining birth rates in Europe.</p>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p06">A third very important difference is that European nations provide free or heavily subsidized child care of generally high quality to enable parents to work outside the home. For example, France provides free child care for children ages 2–6 and pays 75 percent of the cost of child care for children under 2.</p>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p07">In these and other ways, the nations of Western Europe help their families with young children and thus their societies as a whole. The United States has much to learn from their example.</p>
        <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p99"><em class="emphasis">Sources:</em> Russell, 2011; Shahmehri, 2007<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn10_078">Russell, J. W.

    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p08">Another issue and set of implications from social science research concern family violence. To the extent that much violence against intimates and children is rooted in the frustration and stress accompanying poverty, efforts that reduce poverty will also reduce family violence. And to the extent that gender inequality helps explain violence against women, continuing and strengthening efforts to reduce gender inequality should also reduce violence against intimates, as most of this violence is directed by men against women. Further, if, as many scholars believe, the violent nature of masculinity helps account for violence men commit against their wives and girlfriends, then efforts to change male gender-role socialization should also help.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p09">Turning to child abuse, because so much child abuse remains unknown to child protective authorities, it is difficult to reduce its seriousness and extent. However, certain steps might still help. Because child abuse seems more common among poorer families, then efforts that reduce poverty should also reduce child abuse. The home visitation programs that help poor children also help reduce child abuse. Although, as noted earlier, approval of spanking is deeply rooted in our culture, a national educational campaign to warn about the dangers of spanking, including its promotion of children’s misbehavior, may eventually reduce the use of spanking and thus the incidence of child physical abuse.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch10_s04_p10">Divorce is a final issue for which research by sociologists and other scholars is relevant. Much evidence suggests that divorce from low-conflict marriages has negative consequences for spouses and children, and some evidence suggests that these consequences arise not from the divorce itself but rather from the conflict preceding the divorce and the poverty into which many newly single-parent households are plunged. There is also evidence that spouses and children fare better after a divorce from a highly contentious marriage. Efforts to help preserve marriages should certainly continue, but these efforts should proceed cautiously or not proceed at all for the marriages that are highly contentious. To the extent that marital conflict partly arises from financial difficulties, once again government efforts that help reduce poverty should also help preserve marriages.</p>
