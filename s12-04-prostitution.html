Many people, and especially those with conservative, religious views, believe prostitution is immoral because it involves sex for money, and they consider prostitution a sign of society’s moral decay. Many feminists believe that prostitution is degrading to women and provides a context in which prostitutes are robbed, beaten, and/or raped. These two groups of people might agree on little else, but they both hold strong negative views about prostitution. Regardless of their other beliefs, many people also worry that prostitution spreads STDs. All these groups think prostitution should remain illegal, and they generally prefer stricter enforcement of laws against prostitution.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_p02">Other people also do not like prostitution, but they believe that the laws against prostitution do more harm than good. They think that legalizing prostitution would reduce the various harms prostitution causes, and they believe that views about the immorality of prostitution should not prevent our society from dealing more wisely with it than it does now.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">History of Prostitution</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_p01">Often called the world’s oldest profession, prostitution has been common since ancient times (Ringdal, 2004).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_042">Ringdal, N. J. (2004). <em class="emphasis">Love for sale: A world history of prostitution</em> (R. Daly, Trans.). New York, NY: Grove Press.</span> In ancient Mesopotamia, priests had sex with prostitutes. Ancient Greece featured legal <em class="emphasis">brothels</em> (houses of prostitution) that serviced political leaders and common men alike. Prostitution was also common in ancient Rome, and in the Old Testament it was “accepted as a more or less necessary fact of life and it was more or less expected that many men would turn to prostitutes” (Bullough &amp; Bullough, 1977, pp. 137–138).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_043">Bullough, V. L., &amp; Bullough, B. (1977). <em class="emphasis">Sin, sickness, and sanity: A history of sexual attitudes</em>. New York, NY: New American Library.</span> During the Middle Ages and through the nineteenth century, prostitution was tolerated as a necessary evil, as legal brothels operated in much of Europe and were an important source of tax revenue. As the dangers of venereal disease became known, some cities shut down their brothels, but other cities required regular medical exams of their brothels’ prostitutes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_p02">Prostitution was also common in the United States through the nineteenth century (Bullough &amp; Bullough, 1987).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_044">Bullough, V. L., &amp; Bullough, B. (1987). <em class="emphasis">Women and prostitution: A social history</em>. Buffalo, NY: Prometheus.</span> Poor women became prostitutes because it provided a source of income at a time when they had few other options for jobs. Some prostitutes worked for themselves on streets and in hotels and other establishments, and other prostitutes worked in legal brothels in many US cities. During the Civil War, prostitutes found many customers among the soldiers of the Union and the Confederacy; the term <em class="emphasis">hooker</em> for prostitute comes from their relations with soldiers commanded by Union general Joseph Hooker. After the Civil War, camps of prostitutes would set up at railroad construction sites. When the railroad workers would visit the camps at night, they hung their red signal lamps outside the prostitutes’ tents so they could be found if there was a railroad emergency. The term “red-light district” for a prostitution area originated in the red glow that resulted from this practice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s01_p03">Many US cities had legal brothels into the early 1900s. Beginning in about 1910, however, religious groups and other parties increasingly spoke out about the immorality of prostitution, and in addition claimed that middle-class girls were increasingly becoming prostitutes. Their efforts succeeded in shutting down legal brothels nationwide. Some illegal brothels continued, and among their number was a San Francisco brothel run during the 1940s by a <em class="emphasis">madam</em> (brothel manager and/or owner) named Sally Stanford. Her clientele included many leading politicians and businessmen of San Francisco and nearby areas. Like other earlier brothels, Stanford’s brothel required regular medical exams of her employees to help prevent the spread of venereal diseases (Stanford, 1966).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_045">Stanford, S. (1966). <em class="emphasis">The lady of the house</em>. New York, NY: G. P.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Prostitution in the United States Today</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p01">No one really knows how many prostitutes we now have. Prostitutes are not eager to be studied, and because their work is illegal, the federal government does not compile statistics on their numbers as it does for physicians, plumbers, teachers, and hundreds of other legal occupations. One well-analyzed estimate put the number of female prostitutes at 70,000 and further concluded that they engage in an average of 700 acts of prostitution with male customers annually, or almost 50 million acts of prostitution overall each year (Brewer et al., 2000).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_046">Brewer, D. D., Potterat, J. J., Garrett, S. B., Muth, S. Q., John M. Roberts, J., Kasprzyk, D., et al. (2000). Prostitution and the sex discrepancy in reported number of sexual partners. <em class="emphasis">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 97</em>, 12385–12388.</span> However, other estimates put the number of prostitutes as high as 500,000, with many of these prostitutes working part-time, whether or not they also work in a legal occupation (Clinard &amp; Meier, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_047">Clinard, M. B., &amp; Meier, R. F. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Sociology of deviant behavior</em> (14th ed.). Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p02">Regardless of the actual number, prostitution is very common. The GSS asks, “Thinking about the time since your 18<sup class="superscript">th</sup> birthday, have you ever had sex with a person you paid or who paid you for sex?” In 2010, 11.9 percent of men and 1.7 percent of women answered “yes” to this question. These figures translate to about 13.5 million men 18 and older who have engaged in prostitution, usually as the customer, and 2.1 million women.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_p03">In 2010, police and other law enforcement agents made almost 63,000 arrests for prostitution and commercialized vice (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_048">Federal Bureau of Investigation. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Crime in the United States, 2010</em>. Washington, DC: Author.</span> Most of these arrests were of prostitutes, but some were of customers. Women accounted for almost 69 percent of the arrests in this entire category.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p01">Several types of prostitutes exist. At the bottom of the prostitution “hierarchy” are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">streetwalkers</a><span class="glossdef">Prostitutes who typically find their customers, or are found by their customers, on a street and who then have a quick act of sex in the customer’s car, in an alleyway or other secluded spot, or in a cheap hotel.</span></span> (also called <em class="emphasis">street prostitutes</em>), who typically find their customers, or are found by their customers, somewhere on a street. They then have a quick act of sex in the customer’s car, in an alleyway or other secluded spot, or in a cheap hotel. Although streetwalkers are the subjects in most studies of prostitutes, they in fact compose only about one-fifth of all prostitutes (Weitzer, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_049">Weitzer, R.

Their clients are typically businessmen or other wealthy individuals. Many call girls earn between $200 and $500 per hour, and some earn between $1,000 and $6,000 per hour or per session (Weitzer, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_050">Weitzer, R.

They may operate out of an apartment rented by their agency or come to a client’s hotel room or other location. Although they may actually act as an escort to a dinner or show, typically their services include sexual acts. They, too, are generally well paid for their work, but do not earn nearly as much as call girls because they have to give at least 30 percent of their earnings to their agency.</p>

They make contact with a customer in these settings and then have sex with them elsewhere.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p04">The lives and welfare of streetwalkers are much worse than those of the five types of indoor workers just listed. As sociologist Ronald Weitzer (2012, p. 212)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_052">Weitzer, R. (2012). Prostitution: Facts and fictions. In D. Hartmann &amp; C. Uggen (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">The contexts reader</em> (pp. 223–230). New York, NY: W. W. Norton.</span> observes, “Many of the problems associated with ‘prostitution’ are actually concentrated in street prostitution and much less evident in the indoor sector.” In particular, many streetwalkers are exploited or abused by pimps, use heroin or other drugs, and are raped, robbed, and/or beaten by their clients. A good number of streetwalkers also began their prostitution careers as runaway teenagers and were abused as children.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s02_s01_p05">In contrast, indoor workers begin their trade when they were older and are less likely to have been abused as children. Their working conditions are much better than those for streetwalkers, they are less likely to be addicted to drugs and to have STDs, they are better paid, and they are much less likely to be victimized by their clients. Studies that compare indoor prostitutes with nonprostitutes find that they have similar levels of self-esteem, physical health, and mental health. Many indoor prostitutes even report a rise in self-esteem after they begin their indoor work (Weitzer, 2012).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_053">Weitzer, R. (2012).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Explaining Prostitution</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p01">By definition, prostitution involves the selling of sex. This means that money is the key feature of prostitution. As such, money is also the major motivation for women who become prostitutes, as most of them come from low-income backgrounds. For indoor workers, and especially call girls, prostitution is a potentially well-paying occupation. Streetwalkers hardly get rich from prostitution and suffer the many problems listed earlier, but prostitution still provides them a source of income that they are unlikely to receive through legal occupations because they have few marketable job skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_p02">Despite this financial motivation, most women do not become prostitutes, and scholars have tried to understand why some women do so. Because prostitutes are not eager to be studied, as noted earlier, we do not yet have studies of random samples of prostitutes, and probably never will have such studies. As also noted earlier, most studies of prostitutes involve streetwalkers, even though they compose only about 20 percent of all prostitutes. Several of these studies cite high rates of child abuse in the backgrounds of streetwalkers, but other studies find that their rates of child abuse are similar to those of women from similar sociodemographic backgrounds who are not prostitutes (Weitzer, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_054">Weitzer, R. (2009). Sociology of sex work. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Sociology, 35</em>(0360-0572, 0360-0572), 213–234.</span> Although some studies find certain psychological problems among streetwalkers, it is unclear whether these problems existed before they became streetwalkers or developed (as is very possible) after they became streetwalkers. Methodologically, the best way to clarify this causal question would be to randomly assign young women to become prostitutes or not to become prostitutes, and then to study what happens to their psychological health afterward. For many reasons, this type of study would be highly unethical and will never be done. In the absence of studies of this type, it is difficult to determine what exactly prompts some women to become prostitutes.</p>

        <div class="section" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Customers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_s01_p01">There is an old saying that “it takes two to tango.” Prostitution obviously cannot occur unless a customer wants to pay for the services of a prostitute. Despite this essential fact of prostitution, there are very few studies of why men choose to become customers. The implicit message from this lack of studies is that it is normal for men to have sex with a prostitute but abnormal for women to charge these men for this sex. The few studies we do have do not find any substantial differences between customers and noncustomers (Weitzer, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_055">Weitzer, R. (2009). Sociology of sex work. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Sociology, 35</em>(0360-0572, 0360-0572), 213–234.</span> Just as men come from various social backgrounds, so do the men who choose to have sex with a prostitute.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_s01_p02">Customers do have certain motivations for choosing to pay for prostitution (Weitzer, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_056">Weitzer, R. (2009). Sociology of sex work. <em class="emphasis">Annual Review of Sociology, 35</em>(0360-0572, 0360-0572), 213–234.</span> These motivations include (1) the desire to have sex with someone with a certain physical appearance (age, race, body type); (2) the lack of a sexual partner or dissatisfaction with a sexual partner, including a desire to have unconventional sex that the partner does not share; (3) the thrill of having sex with a prostitute; and (4) the desire to have sex without having to make an emotional commitment. Although one or more of these motivations may be necessary for a man’s decision to seek prostitution, they do not entirely explain this decision. For example, many men may not have a sexual partner or may be dissatisfied with a partner they do have, but they still do not decide to pay for a prostitute.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_s02_p02">According to <em class="emphasis">functionalist theory</em>, prostitution exists because it serves several important functions for society generally and for certain people in society. As we have already mentioned, it provides a source of income for many women who otherwise might be jobless, and it provides a sexual alternative for men with the motivations listed earlier. Almost eight decades ago, sociologist Kingsley Davis (1937)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_057">Davis, K. (1937). The sociology of prostitution. <em class="emphasis">American Sociological Review, 2</em>, 744–755.</span> wrote that prostitution even lowers the divorce rate. He reasoned that many married men are unhappy with their sex life with their wives. If they do not think this situation can improve, some men start an affair with another woman and may fall in love with that woman, threatening these men’s marriages. Other men turn to a prostitute. Because prostitution is generally impersonal, these men do not fall in love with their prostitutes, and their marriages are not threatened. Without prostitution, then, more men would have affairs, and more divorces would result. Although Davis’s hypothesis is provocative, there are no adequate studies to test it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_s02_p03">According to <em class="emphasis">conflict theory</em>, prostitution reflects the economic inequality in society. Many poor women feel compelled to become prostitutes because of their lack of money; because wealthier women have many other sources of income, the idea of becoming a prostitute is something they never have to consider. Sad but interesting historical support for this view comes from an increase in prostitution in the second half of the nineteenth century. Many women lost husbands and boyfriends in the war and were left penniless. Lacking formal education and living in a society that at the time offered few job opportunities to women, many of these bereaved women were forced to turn to prostitution to feed their families and themselves. As American cities grew rapidly during the last decades of the nineteenth century, thousands of immigrant women and other poor women also turned to prostitution as a needed source of income (Rosen, 1983).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_058">Rosen, R.

            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_s02_p04">According to the <em class="emphasis">feminist</em> version of conflict theory, prostitution results not only from women’s poverty but also from society’s patriarchal culture that still views men as the dominant figure in heterosexual relationships and that still treats women as “sex objects” who exist for men’s pleasure (Barry, 1996).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_059">Barry, K. (1996). <em class="emphasis">The prostitution of sexuality</em>. New York, NY: New York University Press.</span> In such a culture, it is no surprise and even inevitable that men will want to pay for sex with a woman and that women will be willing to be paid for sex. In this feminist view, the oppression and exploitation that prostitution inherently involves reflects the more general oppression and exploitation of women in the larger society.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s03_s02_p05"><em class="emphasis">Symbolic interactionism</em> moves away from these larger issues to examine the everyday understandings that prostitutes and their customers have about their behavior. These understandings help both prostitutes and customers justify their behavior. Many prostitutes, for example, believe they are performing an important service for the men who pay them. Indoor prostitutes are perhaps especially likely to feel they are helping their customers by providing them not only sex but also companionship (Weitzer, 2009).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_060">Weitzer, R.

Her business employed fourteen women who masturbated their customers and offered a senior citizen discount. The owner reasoned that her employees were performing an important service: “We have many senior citizens and handicapped people. We have some men who are impotent and others who are divorced or in bad marriages. This is a safe, AIDS-free environment…that helps marriages. Husbands come in here and get a stress release and then they are able to go home and take on more. These are men who aren’t in bars picking up strange women” (Ordway, 1995, p. 1).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_061">Ordway, R. (1995, May 26).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Dealing with Prostitution</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p01">With prostitution, past is once again prologue. It has existed since ancient times, and it has continued throughout the United States long since prostitution was banned by the United States in 1920. The legal brothels that now exist in rural counties in Nevada are the exception in this nation, not the rule. Yet prostitution is common outside of Nevada, and thousands of arrests occur nationwide for it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p02">As with illegal drugs (see <a class="xref" href="barkansoc_1.0-ch07#barkansoc_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "Alcohol and Other Drugs"</a>), as we think about how to deal with prostitution, we should consider both a philosophical question and a social science question (Meier &amp; Geis, 2007).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_062">Meier, R. F., &amp; Geis, G. (2007). <em class="emphasis">Criminal justice and moral issues</em>. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.</span> The philosophical question is whether two people should be allowed to engage in a behavior, in this case prostitution, in which both want to participate. Many people may dislike this behavior for various reasons, but is that sufficient justification for the behavior to be banned if both people (let’s assume they are legal adults) want to engage in it? In this regard, and without at all meaning to equate prostitution with same-sex sexual behavior, an analogy with homosexuality is worth considering. Homosexual sex used to be illegal because many people thought it was immoral. When the US Supreme Court finally invalidated all laws against homosexual sex in its 2003 case, <em class="emphasis">Lawrence v. Texas</em>, the majority opinion declared that “the fact that a State’s governing majority has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice.” It further asserted, “The petitioners are entitled to respect for their private lives. The State cannot demean their existence or control their destiny by making their private sexual conduct a crime. Their right to liberty under the Due Process Clause gives them the full right to engage in their conduct without intervention of the government.” Although the majority opinion specifically said its decision did not apply to prostitution, a reasonable argument may be made that respect for privacy of consensual sexual conduct also means that prostitution, too, should be legal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p03">Here it may be argued that prostitution still victimizes and objectifies women even if they want to engage in it. This is a reasonable argument, but there are many occupations that victimize employees, either because the occupations are dangerous (such as coal mining and construction work) or because the job requirements objectify women as sex objects (such as fashion modeling and cheerleading). Because hardly anyone would say these occupations should be illegal, is it logical to say that prostitution should be illegal? Former US Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders thinks it makes no sense to ban prostitution simply because it objectifies women: “Why are we so upset about sex workers selling sexual acts to consenting adults?” she asks. “We say that they are selling their bodies, but how different is that from what athletes do? They’re selling their bodies. Models? They’re selling their bodies. Actors? They’re selling their bodies” (McCaslin, 1999, p. A8).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_063">McCaslin, J. (1999, October 13). Vaginal politics. <em class="emphasis">Washington Times</em>, p. A8.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p04">The social science question concerning laws against prostitution is whether these laws do more good than harm, or more harm than good. If they do more good than harm, they should be maintained and even strengthened; if they do more harm than good, they should be repealed. A growing number of scholars believe that the laws against prostitution do more harm than good, and they say that the best way to deal with prostitution might be to legalize and regulate it (Weitzer, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_064">Weitzer, R. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Legalizing prostitution: From illicit vice to lawful business</em>. New York, NY: New York University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p05">Proponents of legalization argue as follows. Although many people cite the horrible lives of many streetwalkers as a major reason for their support of laws against prostitution, these laws ironically cause the problems that streetwalkers experience (Weitzer, 2011). When US prostitution was legal a century ago in brothels across the nation, brothel prostitutes were safer than streetwalkers are now. Prostitutes working today in Nevada’s legal brothels are safer than streetwalkers. Whatever we might think of their behavior, legal brothel workers are relatively safe from being robbed, beaten, or raped, and their required regular medical exams leave them relatively free of sexually transmitted disease. The health problems and criminal victimization that many streetwalkers experience happen <em class="emphasis">because</em> their behavior is illegal, and legalizing and regulating prostitution would reduce these problems (Weitzer, 2011).<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_065">Weitzer, R. (2011). <em class="emphasis">Legalizing prostitution: From illicit vice to lawful business</em>. New York, NY: New York University Press.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p06">In this regard, legalization of prostitution is yet another <em class="emphasis">harm reduction</em> approach to a social problem. As Weitzer (2012, p. 227)<span class="footnote" id="barkansoc_1.0-fn09_066">Weitzer, R. (2012). Prostitution: Facts and fictions. In D. Hartmann &amp; C. Uggen (Eds.), <em class="emphasis">The contexts reader</em> (pp. 223–230). New York, NY: W. W. Norton.</span> observes, “Research suggests that, under the right conditions, legal prostitution can be organized in a way that increases workers’ health, safety, and job satisfaction. Mandatory condom use and other safe-sex practices are typical in legal brothels, and the workers face much lower risk of abuse from customers.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p07">Legalization of prostitution would also yield a considerable amount of tax revenue, as is now true in Nevada. Let’s assume that 50 million acts of prostitution occur annually in the United States, to cite our earlier estimate that is probably too low, and that each of these acts costs an average $30. Putting these numbers together, prostitutes receive $1.5 billion annually in income. If they paid about one-third of this amount (admittedly a rough estimate) in payroll taxes, the revenue of state and federal governments would increase by $500 million. Because the tens of thousands of arrests for prostitution and commercialized vice annually would reduce significantly if prostitution were legalized, the considerable financial savings from this reduction could be used for other pursuits.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p08">Legalizing prostitution would add the United States to the lengthy list of other Western democracies that have already legalized it. Although their models of legalization vary, the available evidence indicates that legalizing prostitution does, in fact, reduce the many problems now associated with illegal prostitution (see <a class="xref" href="#barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_n01">Note 9.25 "Lessons from Other Societies"</a>).</p>

            <h3 class="title">Lessons from Other Societies</h3>
            <p class="simpara">Legal Brothels in Other Western Democracies</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p09">In many other Western democracies, prostitution is legal to varying degrees that depend on the specific nation. In some nations, streetwalking is permitted, but in other nations, only brothels are permitted.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p10">The legal brothel model is what the United States had a century ago and has today only in rural Nevada. As in Nevada, other nations that permit legal brothels usually require regular health exams and the use of condoms to prevent the transmission of sexual diseases. They also license the brothels so that the brothels must fulfill various standards, including the safe-sex practices just mentioned, to receive a license. In addition, brothels must pay taxes on their revenues, and brothel workers must pay taxes on their incomes.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p11">As in rural Nevada, brothel workers in these other nations are unlikely to be abused by their customers. A major reason for their relative safety is that they work indoors and that any abuse by customers might be heard or witnessed by someone else inside the brothel. In addition, brothels in many nations have implemented certain measures to ensure workers’ safety, including the provision of panic buttons, the use of listening devices, and screening of customers when they enter the brothel.</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p12">A report by the Ministry of Justice in the Netherlands, where legal brothels operate, has concluded that most brothel workers say that they feel safe. A government report in New Zealand, which legalized prostitution in 2003, concluded that legalization made it more likely that prostitutes report any problems to the police and also increased their self-esteem because their behavior was now legal. A government commission in Australia that evaluated legal brothels in the northeastern state of Queensland concluded, “There is no doubt that licensed brothels provide the safest working environment for sex workers in Queensland…Legal brothels now powering in Queensland provide a sustainable model for a healthy, crime-free, and safe legal licensed brothel industry.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="barkansoc_1.0-ch09_s04_s04_p13">Assessing all these nations’ experiences, sociologist Ronald Weitzer concluded that “legal prostitution, while no panacea, is not inherently dangerous and can be structured to minimize risks and empower workers.” The United States, then, has much to learn from the other Western democracies that have legalized prostitution.</p>
